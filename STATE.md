# STATE — live build-state record

> **This is the authoritative, living record of what this project actually is. It supersedes the

> as the historical origin record.** Read this first at the start of any session; **every build

## 1. What this is

An AI-native, long-biased, US-first concentrated equity fund. The edge is **deep human judgment on
finalists**, applied at scale because an AI-native funnel feeds it. It is currently in **forward
paper-validation**: the only thing that gates going live with real money is the **BUY−AVOID forward-
return spread** on the manual discriminator's verdicts — which needs calendar time to accumulate.
**The fund is unproven: zero resolved verdicts so far, no spread yet.**

**What it's FOR — the objective, in causal order: LP RETURNS → AUM GROWTH → MOAT-BUILDING.** Returns
build LP confidence and grow AUM; growing AUM earns the time and capital to compound durable,
non-replicable moats. Non-replicability is **INSTRUMENTAL** — it makes returns durable and defensible
at scale — NOT the terminal goal; the terminal goal is LP returns and the AUM growth they enable.

## 2. Built and verified (checked against the repo, not memory)

Each line: *what it does* — *verified how*.

- **Entity resolver** (`vinci/resolver`) — US SEC CIK↔ticker↔name, fail-loud on unknown/ambiguous —
  *ran `resolve AAPL GOOGL GOOG BRK.B ZZZZZ`: GOOGL/GOOG→one CIK, BRK.B→BRK-B, ZZZZZ fails loud.*
- **Polygon EOD** (`vinci/eod`) — whole-market grouped-daily, 5y history (Starter) — *universe/screen ran on 5y bars.*
- **EDGAR** (`vinci/edgar`) — XBRL `companyfacts`/`frames` + 8-K full-text + submissions — *feeds G3; module + tests.*
- **Universe builder** (`vinci/universe`) — market cap = close × XBRL shares, cap-band + $3M ADV +
  an **operating-cos-only gate on TWO fail-closed axes** — *`build-universe` ran → 1,727 names (drifts
  a few as SEC data updates).*
  - **Two independent operating-co axes, each fail-CLOSED on a missing value (exclude what we cannot
    confirm; never silently admit) — built + verified 2026-06-19 by a full rebuild:**
    - **Axis 1 — issuer BUSINESS type (EDGAR SIC).** Denylist `excluded_sic_codes =
      6189/6221/6722/6726/6770` (`non_operating=38`) PLUS a **blank/unknown SIC is now excluded**
      (`unknown_sic=29`) — closing the hole where a BDC with no EDGAR SIC slipped the denylist (`None`
      is never `in` the set). *The 29 are 28 BDCs (CION, OTF, Prospect, Main Street, FS KKR, Sixth
      Street, …) + 1 foreign miner; the BDC candidates CION/OTF/GLAD/MSIF/PFLT left the queue.*
    - **Axis 2 — security INSTRUMENT type (Polygon reference; `PolygonEodClient.security_types()`,
      one cached bulk pull).** An **ALLOWLIST** `allowed_security_types = CS/ADRC/OS/GDR` (domestic
      common / ADR common / foreign ordinary / GDR); everything else excluded, split for honesty into
      `non_common_equity=7` (a confirmed basket/derivative — SHNY=ETS, DHC/ILPT=FUND, MNR/NOVTU/VSECU=
      UNIT, CORZW=WARRANT) and `unknown_type=4` (absent from Polygon's reference = recently delisted,
      stale bars — MASI/KW/KALV/SCVL, last trade before the 06-17 ref). *SHNY left both the universe
      AND the queue; the 14 ADRC candidates (ABVX, ATHM, CHA, DQ, …) survive — ADRC is admitted, so
      operating-co ADRs are not dropped.*
  - **SHNY was NOT a resolver collision.** Its ticker→CIK (→ cik 927971, Bank of Montreal) is
    **correct** — BMO *issues* the SHNY ETN (one of 27 BMO tickers). It was an **untyped-instrument
    leak**: a leveraged ETN (Polygon type ETS) whose bank fundamentals describe none of it, now caught
    by Axis 2 — not by any ticker-validation (a collision guard was built, then reverted as the wrong
    diagnosis). Axis 2's fail-closed-on-missing also sweeps recently-delisted names the 90-day price
    gate still admitted (an as-of-now vs as-of-date asymmetry, acceptable for a forward-tradeable
    universe).
- **Screen 2 + gates** (`vinci/screens`) — G1 drawdown ≤−30% (capped at −85% terminal floor) / G2
  idiosyncratic **vs the IWM market index** (NOT a sector cohort — see caveat) / G3 multiple vs ~5y
  floor (`_PE_WINDOW_DAYS=1825`); PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN, recall-favoring — *`screen` / `run-weekly` → 317
  candidates @ ref 2026-06-22 (was 301 @ 06-17; the universe/screen drift weekly as SEC+EOD data
  update), A/B/C bands.* G1 drawdown = `last close / max(intraday HIGH
  over trailing 365d) − 1` (`eod/features.compute_price_features`, ≥330d history else UNKNOWN).
  - **Re-screen accretion bug — FIXED 2026-06-23 (root cause + regression-pinned).** The first weekly
    re-run produced a DOUBLED candidate set (618 = last week's 301 + this week's 317, 287 tickers
    twice) and the ranker faithfully ranked the duplicates. **Root cause = the screen WRITE path, not
    just `run_weekly`:** `screen_universe` cleared only the *current* run's `screen_run_at`
    (`clear_candidates(run_at)`), so a re-screen on a NEW reference date layered on top of prior
    generations instead of replacing them — any caller accretes (the `screen` CLI too); `run_weekly`
    merely triggers it by `rebuild_from_snapshots`-ing last week's set first. The writer
    (`save_candidate`, INSERT-OR-REPLACE by id) was never at fault. **Fix:** `clear_candidates()` is
    now a FULL replace (`DELETE FROM candidate_records`), matching its own docstring — a re-screen is a
    clean snapshot. **Regression-pinned:** `test_rescreen_replaces_not_accretes` runs the screen TWICE
    consecutively and asserts the stored set is the SECOND run's only (week-1 ids gone), NOT the union
    — it FAILS on the old run-scoped clear, passes on the fix (both shown). *Cleaned: dropped the 618,
    re-ran the fixed screen → 317 single-generation candidates (no dup ids), re-ranked → 47/317
    structurally sunk, top-15 unique.* (Side effect: the `ev_ebitda` legacy-float compat test was
    decoupled from the live snapshot — the current producer defers all `ev_ebitda` to UNKNOWN, so the
    legacy present-float shape is now guarded by a synthetic record, not the live snapshot's contents.)
  - **G2 "idiosyncratic" is name-vs-IWM, NOT name-vs-SIC-sector (verified 2026-06-19; the field was
    then renamed `rel_ret_vs_sector` → `rel_ret_vs_market`, the old name being a lie — it compares to
    IWM, not a sector).** `assemble.build_price_record` sets it to
    `relative_return(name_bars, benchmark_bars, lookback_days=180)` = **name 180d trailing return − IWM
    180d trailing return** (`eod/features.relative_return`; `run.py` passes `benchmark="IWM"`). It is a
    *trailing return*, not peak-to-current drawdown. The SIC peer-cohort was **deferred and never built**
    (`features.py:135` leaves the field UNKNOWN, note "needs SIC peers (step 5)"; **no SIC-cohort /
    peer-aggregation code exists anywhere in `vinci/`** — so the Part-1 sub-questions on SIC
    source/granularity/aggregate/thin-cohort are all moot). So G2 removes **market** beta only — a name
    that fell *with its sector* (sector-wide derate) still PASSES G2 if it merely lagged IWM. *Re-derived
    FUBO from raw bars: depth −84.3% (=snapshot, close 8.90 / 52w high-of-highs 56.64); idio −88.2%
    (=snapshot) = FUBO −72.6% − IWM **+15.6%** over 180d — the "−88% vs market" is FUBO's fall minus the
    small-cap market's RISE, no sector comparison at all.*
- **Ranker / triage layer** (`vinci/rank`, `rank` CLI) — **orders** the ~307 candidates into a
  priority queue so a 2-person team deep-pulls the most structurally-promising overshoots first.
  A *transparent* weighted composite of the Tier-1 axes (idiosyncrasy .30 / drawdown-depth .25 /
  **drawdown-character .25** / multiple-vs-own-5y .20 — **face-validity weights, never
  return-tuned**), + a minor Tier-2 volume overlay (±0.05, panic-exhausted vs still-distributing),
  coloured by a Tier-3 LLM cause-annotation that only **demotes/colours** (structural-break vs
  mean-revert, `UNCLASSIFIED` by default — never fabricated). *drawdown-character folds shape (sharp
  vs grind) and cause (discrete event vs bleed) into ONE axis today — both rest on the same EOD
  gap-down detector, so two axes would be false precision; splits back out when 8-K/guidance TEXT
  events land (§4).* Tradeability is an **ADV gate** (not a quality signal; default floor = universe
  floor, a no-op re-check — adds no filtering). **Orders, never decides; a lagging/coincident
  description of the existing setup, not a return prediction.** **Replaces the bare A/B/C band with a
  legible per-name structural profile** (score *and* profile are the same artifact — priority score +
  per-axis breakdown that sums back to it; A/B/C kept only as a quick depth tag). Fail-loud: an
  UNKNOWN axis earns 0 credit and is flagged for depth, never imputed — *ran `rank` on the committed
  308 snapshot → top-15 legible profiles, every position reconstructs from weight·sub-score + overlay
  (ICCM's 61.7× active-distribution overlay sinks it from a top-2 quality to #6); 156 UNKNOWN-multiple
  names flagged; ADV floor $10M gates 75 thin names to the queue bottom; a structural-break flag
  demotes FUBO #1→#12 while mean-revert lifts PAR #3→#1. 31 tests incl. an AST guard that
  `vinci.rank` imports no scoring/ledger/store (no forward-return path). Emits
  `ranked_queue.{jsonl,md}` snapshots.*
  - **Coverage caveat (an upstream data gap, NOT a ranker defect):** the ranking is **most reliable
    for names with a *confirmed* at-floor multiple, weaker for the ~51% without one** —
    multiple-percentile is present for only ~49% (P/E only; **EV/EBITDA pctile never populated** →
    that axis is UNKNOWN/0-credit, flagged, for the rest); **market_cap is 100% UNKNOWN** so
    tradeability rests on ADV alone; **events are 100% EOD `earnings_gap_down`** (no 8-K/guidance
    text — so drawdown-character is one axis, and Tier-2 reads *current* volume, not volume-at-the-
    gap). All handled fail-loud (UNKNOWN → 0-credit + flagged, never imputed) — correct behaviour; the
    fix is upstream coverage (§4), recorded not chased.
  - **Tier-3 DETERMINISTIC structural-disqualifier channel** (`vinci/rank/structural.py`, `rank
    --structural` flag) — **DEMOTE-ONLY, source-bound, off by default (network).** Reads the **free**
    EDGAR 8-K full text (item codes + body) + the EDGAR-XBRL shares series already used for market
    cap, and flags TERMINAL/STRUCTURAL signals only: **restatement/non-reliance (Item 4.02)**,
    **going-concern / substantial-doubt** (filing text), **delisting/deficiency (Item 3.01)**,
    **auditor resignation/dismissal (Item 4.01 + resign/dismiss verb)**, and a **dilution death-spiral**
    (shares ↑ ≥50% into a ≤−50% TRAILING drawdown — the *already-computed* historical drawdown, never
    a forward return). A fired flag **caps `priority_score` at 0.05 via `min()` (can only LOWER) and
    sorts the name to the queue bottom** — **there is NO promote path**; default is `UNCLASSIFIED`
    (`None`) → **zero effect, never fabricated**. Every flag is **source-bound** (accession + item +
    date, or the two share datapoints) so the human verifies. This completes the Tier-3 slot that was
    `UNCLASSIFIED` because 8-K text was never wired; it is **separate** from the LLM cause-annotation
    channel (which can boost mean-revert) — *this* one can only sink. **Its only job is triage hygiene
    — stop wasting CIQ deep-pull on structurally-dead names; NOT a return predictor.** *Verified by a
    real run: `rank --structural --no-write` over the committed 301-candidate snapshot → **50 sunk**
    (23 dilution-spiral / 10 auditor-exit / 7 restatement / 5 going-concern / 5 delisting; was 54
    before the post-review auditor-precision fix below), each traced to a specific 8-K
    (accession+item+date) or XBRL share series; **deterministic** (a warm re-scan reproduces the same
    set). Read the primary filing for the non-trivial cases: RGC dilution = **13.0M → 494.5M** shares;
    TLRY/EOSE/ZBIO going-concern + MVST/BBAI restatement language confirmed in the cited 8-K.*
    **Honest precision caveat — by design, not a defect:** the signals fire on structural **FORM**
    (item code + verb / language / share-count delta), which has a residual false-positive surface —
    e.g. **MBLY's "dilution" is Intel's Class-B→A distribution**, not new issuance. (The auditor leg
    also over-fired on routine changes — FUBO's merger-driven KPMG dismissal, a clean Big-4 switch —
    and was tightened post-review to require auditor-proximity + cause; PODD still fires, **correctly**,
    on its disclosed material weakness.) That is exactly why the channel is **demote-to-verify, never
    auto-kill**: it sinks a name for a human verification glance with the source attached; **the
    machine sinks + cites, the
    human concludes** (CLAUDE.md). Tests: each signal fires + is source-bound, dilution needs BOTH
    legs, default-`None` never fabricated, severity ordering, the explicit **no-promote-path** test
    (flagged score ≤ unflagged across strong+weak setups, sunk ≤ the 0.05 cap), sink-below-a-clean-name
    in the queue, no-flag leaves score/sort untouched; the AST no-forward-returns guard extended to
    assert `structural.py` is in scope. ruff + `mypy --strict` clean.
    - **Hardened post-code-review (pre-push audit).** (1) **Whole-scan resilience:** `scan_structural`
      now wraps each candidate in a per-name `except Exception` (mirrors `assemble_cohort`) — one bad
      EDGAR response or corrupt cache file (`JSONDecodeError`/`TypeError`/`IndexError` the per-extractor
      helpers didn't catch) skips that name, never aborts the 301-name pass; regression-tested.
      (2) **Auditor signal no longer over-fires:** `_AUDITOR_EXIT` was matching any `resign`/`dismiss`
      anywhere in the body → it wrongly DEMOTED good names (a routine Big-4 upgrade, a co-filed 5.02
      director resignation). A wrong demote is a silent miss at the funnel top, which demote-only does
      NOT protect against. Replaced with auditor-PROXIMITY: a resignation near an auditor token fires
      (auditor-initiated), a dismissal fires ONLY with an affirmative cause marker
      (disagreement/material-weakness) so an upgrade ("dismissed X, engaged Y, no disagreements")
      stays unflagged; tested (Big-4 upgrade + director resignation do NOT fire; resignation +
      dismissal-for-cause do). **KNOWN LIMITATION, recorded not fixed (#3):** going-concern body text
      is read only for `_BODY_ITEMS` {2.02,4.01,8.01,4.02}, so going-concern disclosed under
      2.04/1.01 is missed — a **safe-direction MISS** (under-demote → the name still reaches the
      dossier, which reads its 8-Ks and surfaces the distress), consistent with the recall-favoring
      funnel. Fix only if it bites in real use. ruff + `mypy --strict` clean; 178 suite green.
- **Dossier-assembler** (`vinci/dossier`, `dossier` CLI) — per-finalist; **assembles and cites, NEVER
  concludes.** A deterministic source-bound MECHANICAL layer (every fact a `{value, source_ref}`: P/E +
  percentile / FCF-sign / net-leverage from the screen's EDGAR data-record; the gap-down **8-Ks** fetched
  + bound as the de-rating cause; **idiosyncratic-vs-shared** = name vs IWM 180d return + the graph-exposed
  cohort's same-window returns (the G2-vs-market compensation; graph is INPUT, never a predictor);
  share-count/dilution from EDGAR XBRL; CIQ multiples/quality/segments/customers/consensus from a
  **manual** export) + a *fenced* LLM SYNTHESIS whose ONLY input is those facts: bull/bear cases, 3–6
  **named** twin analogues, the decisive question, key unknowns. **The synthesis schema has NO field for a
  verdict / recommendation / direction / score / probability — concluding is structurally impossible**,
  locked by a test that walks the schema (mirrors the ranker's no-forward-returns guard); a second AST
  guard proves the package imports no `ledger`/`scoring` (logging the BUY/AVOID stays the human's act).
  Post-LLM guardrails flag for human review: uncited points (each must cite a source_ref in the input),
  untraceable figures (scale-aware: every number must trace to a mechanical value), numeric/unsourced
  twins, directional language. CIQ via a swappable **ManualDataStore** — `LocalFolderStore` live
  (`data/manual/ciq/<ticker>/`, git-ignored); `DriveStore` an unimplemented interface (CIQ is
  manual-export-only by licence). Missing CIQ → sections MISSING + a "pull CIQ" flag, batch continues;
  parallel across the cohort. *Verified: `dossier --ticker FUBO` end-to-end → mechanical facts
  source-bound (P/E 12.0 at the 0.16%ile of its 5y range, FCF-sign −1, −88.2% vs IWM, 2 gap-down 8-Ks
  bound with accessions, shares 29.6M→342.4M +1055%; CIQ MISSING + flagged; graph cohort UNKNOWN — FUBO
  not in the graph) + a live verdict-free synthesis (claude-sonnet-4-6), every figure tracing to the
  mechanical layer; 11 dossier tests incl. the no-conclusion-field schema guard + the no-ledger import
  guard. Writes `data/dossiers/<ticker>/{dossier.json,dossier.md,llm_call.log}` (git-ignored — may carry
  licensed CIQ).*
  - **CIQ requirements manifest — ONE definition, two consumers (`vinci/dossier/requirements.py`,
    `dossier requirements` CLI).** The canonical list of manual CIQ inputs the assembler expects lives
    in a single `CIQ_MODULES` tuple; each module is a structured record — workbook-kind + the subsheets
    consumed, what the mechanical layer derives from it (names the extractor), granularity, lookback,
    required-vs-optional, expected path `data/manual/ciq/<TICKER>/`. **REQUIRED** = a source-bound FACT
    depends on it (**Financials-Annual + Financials-Quarterly + Estimates + Business Relationships**);
    **OPTIONAL** = synthesis colour only (the **earnings-call transcript**). The **MISSING-manifest**
    path in `assemble_one` and the **`dossier requirements`** command BOTH read `CIQ_MODULES`, so they
    **cannot drift** — an empty folder yields one summary "pull CIQ" flag, a partial folder names each
    still-missing module (freq-strict: the Annual and Quarterly Financials are distinct required
    exports). Documents the **don't-double-pull** rule: 10-K/10-Q, 8-K, Form 4 are FREE on EDGAR (XBRL
    companyfacts / 8-K + Ex-99.1 / Form 4) and must NOT be manually uploaded — `EDGAR_FREE_INPUTS`.
    `--ticker VRRM` renders a per-name export checklist; `--json` emits the machine-readable manifest
    for the frontend upload UI. *Verified: checklist + `--json` (6 modules, 3 EDGAR-free) render; the
    partial-folder manifest flags exactly the 3 still-missing required modules when the annual is
    present; `dossier --top 1` (FUBO, no CIQ folder) now emits the per-module summary flag naming all
    four required modules. 9 tests incl. the single-source anti-drift guard (`assemble.requirements
    is requirements` + both consumers enumerate the same required set).*
    - **Drift-PROOFED against the code it mirrors (AST coverage guard).** `CIQ_MODULES` is a
      hand-maintained mirror of the `(kind, sheet, freq)` addresses the extractors actually read — so
      the two *consumers* can't drift from the tuple, but the tuple could fall behind the *producer*
      (`ciq_sheets.py`). A static AST test now closes that: it scans the dossier package for every
      `bundle.sheet/.workbook` (+ `_miss_or_unknown`) call, requires each kind/freq/sheet arg be a
      string LITERAL, and asserts every consumed `(kind, freq)` is declared in `CIQ_MODULES` and each
      sheet is listed. A new extractor consuming an undeclared kind FAILS the test → must be declared.
      Same idiom as the ranker's no-forward-returns AST guard. *Verified: passes today; a throwaway
      `key_developments` extractor failed it naming `('key_developments', None)`, then removed.* **This
      is correct only while the input set is FIXED (the 6 CIQ modules) — see the §4 registry trigger.**
  - **Cause-parsing + integrity hardening (VRRM run, 2026-06-19) — the dossier must see catalysts that
    live in 8-K TEXT and never mislabel cause.** (1) Each gap-down is labelled by its **8-K item codes**
    (2.02 earnings / 5.02 management change / 8.01 other / 1.02 agreement-termination / 4.02 restatement
    / 3.01 delisting) — never blanket "earnings". (2) The 8-K body is parsed for the **source-bound
    catalyst** (the customer/contract/executive action, bound to the accession), fail-loud
    "UNKNOWN — read filing by hand" when unparseable; free EDGAR only. (3) Share-count trend uses a
    **trailing ~2y** window (a 7y endpoint delta hid the current posture). (4) A **P/E-basis flag** fires
    when trailing EPS is far out of line with the name's recent EPS history (a multiple at its 5y floor
    can be an EPS-numerator artifact — verify vs normalized/forward CIQ). (5) Cite-check **tightened**:
    a "field X is missing" point that cites an unrelated PRESENT field is flagged + un-cited (it belongs
    in key_unknowns). *Verified: VRRM's three drops now read earnings (2.02) / other-event-Avis-
    termination (8.01) / management-change (5.02) — NOT three earnings misses; the 8-K text surfaced
    "termination notice from Avis Budget" + the executive change, source-bound to accessions; the P/E
    1%-ile flagged as an EPS artifact (latest 0.85 vs median 0.28); the synthesis decisive question is
    now the Avis customer-concentration question, not a false repeated-earnings-miss premise.*
  - **Faithfulness-flag noise + P/E-display hardening (2026-06-24) — the flags must read as signal,
    and a distorted multiple must never render as a clean 'cheap' read.** (1) The directional lint
    redacts analyst-RATING context (`sell-side`, `Buy (1.00) recommendation`, a `1=buy…5=sell` scale)
    before scanning, so it no longer fires both 'buy' AND 'sell' on a sentence that merely reports the
    consensus. (2) Flag snippets truncate on a WORD boundary + '…' (no more mid-word '…Phase 3.2 capac').
    (3) The dossier P/E renders **N/A** (not UNKNOWN) when there's no positive EPS, and a PRESENT but
    distorted P/E now carries an inline caveat ON the value (`_pe_reconciliation` returns
    `(flag, pe_note)`; the loss-making case names that the multiple rests on a NON-CURRENT positive EPS)
    — closing the gap where FUBO's 12.1x rendered clean while VRRM's 5.2x had a RESOLVED note. (4) The
    net-debt/EBITDA UNKNOWN note names the SPECIFIC missing input (a positive-EBITDA name reads
    'no net-debt — debt/cash not in XBRL', not the misleading lumped 'EBITDA<=0 or missing'). *Verified:
    VRRM 5→3 / EPAM 3→1 directional flags (the contradictory buy+sell on rating context gone, single
    'recommendation' remains); snippets clean ('…Phase…', '~$71M…'); MVST P/E → N/A; FUBO 12.1x renders
    with the amber distortion caveat (live screenshot + node render). Regression tests: rating-context
    exemption + `_snip`; `_pe_reconciliation` `(flag, note)` incl the non-current-EPS caveat; net-leverage
    note disambiguation. ruff + mypy --strict + pytest -m "not network" green.* (5) **NEW guardrail
    `ANCHORS-ON-DISTORTED-P/E`** — when the mechanical P/E is marked distorted, any BULLISH claim that
    leans on that multiple/percentile as cheap or mean-reverting is flagged (the directional lint missed
    these: hedged phrasing, traceable numbers). *Verified the original audit case: FUBO's pre-fix
    synthesis anchored a mean-reversion bull thesis on the 12.1x / 0.2-pctile P/E (3 claims) un-flagged;
    the guardrail catches all 3 on the stored synthesis. Then **re-assembled FUBO + MVST (opus 4.8)**:
    FUBO's fresh synthesis anchoring dropped 3→1 (the pe caveat steered it), and the guardrail flagged the
    remaining one; zero buy/sell directional noise; MVST's fresh synthesis no longer quotes the old
    net-debt text. **Caveat:** the net-debt NOTE itself is computed at SCREEN time (cached in `vinci.db`),
    so dossier re-assembly reads the stale value — the `edgar/client.py` disambiguation lands on the next
    `run-weekly` (re-screen), not on re-assembly.*
  - **Verification-assertion tripwire + cited≠verified label (2026-06-24) — the dossier CITES, it
    never VERIFIES; the machine asserting it verified something is the one line it can't cross.** A
    new `VERIFICATION-CLAIM` guard flags any synthesis claim whose prose asserts the machine
    verified/proved something (`verified`, `proves that`, `definitively`, `established fact`) — honest
    negations (`unverified`, `cannot be verified`) and benign domain terms (`proven track record`,
    `confirmed orders`) are redacted first, so it fires only on real over-assertion. Frontend: the
    synthesis fence now states **"citations (↳) locate each claim for you to verify — cited is not
    verified"**, and twins are labelled **LLM-selected analogies** (a citation means the data is
    sourced, not that the analogy holds). *Verified: fires NOTHING on all 5 live dossiers (the model
    hedges correctly today) — it is drift insurance; fires on synthetic over-assertions; skips
    `cannot be verified` / `proven track record` / `confirmed orders`. Frontend notes render (preview
    eval, console clean). Regression test added; ruff + mypy --strict + pytest green. Origin: the
    audit question "should we flag data already labelled LLM-verified?" — answer: don't blanket-flag
    cited claims (the ↳ is the verify-this affordance; would be noise), DO flag prose claiming
    verification + clarify the label.*
  - **Flag-noise reduction in "flags for human review" (2026-06-25) — the guards' INTENT is sound;
    the issue was signal-to-noise (~8 of 14 flags low-value on AORT+CNXC).** **FIX 1 (twin contract):**
    the synthesis restated peer caps / Debt-EBITDA in twin prose — figures already source-bound in
    peer_set / fundamental_deltas — which the (deliberately sharp) TWIN-non-numeric guard then flagged.
    Fix = CONTRACT change only (rule 4 + the twin-field + distinguishing_fact descriptions): twins stay
    QUALITATIVE, figures live in the structured fields; the guard is UNCHANGED. **FIX 2
    (VERIFICATION-CLAIM precision):** it fired on "not demonstrably earning" — a NEGATED adverb (a
    hedge), not an over-claim; `_VERIFIED_BENIGN` now redacts negated over-assertion adverbs (tighter,
    NOT blunter — positive "demonstrably true" still fires). **FIX 3 (GAAP-basis caveats):** REPORTED +
    HELD — `flags` is a flat `list[str]`, so re-tiering the always-on EPS/leverage-GAAP caveats to a
    standing-caveat tier (kept VISIBLE — opacity-as-signal) is a schema + render + frontend change;
    awaiting go-ahead, not built in this cleanup. *Verified — REAL opus-4.8 re-runs: AORT 7→3, CNXC
    7→3; TWIN 7→0 with NO info loss (twins stay qualitative + meaningful, caps still in peer_set);
    VERIFICATION-CLAIM 1→0 (deterministic test: the negated hedge clears, 4 genuine over-assertions
    still fire). 2 guard tests adjusted/added; ruff + mypy --strict (66) + pytest green.* **Out of
    scope: wiring CIQ forward EPS to RESOLVE the distorted-P/E flag (separate enhancement).**
  - **Synthesis-reproduces-consensus fix (2026-06-24) — make the CORRECTED read the DEFAULT, flag
    regressions; does NOT claim to eliminate LLM face-value tendency (the guardrail + human verdict are
    the backstop).** Three bounded mechanisms in the existing package, no new data source. **(A) Mechanical
    pairs misleading metrics with their reconciler** so the synthesis can't see the metric without its
    disconfirming context: `margin_trend` now carries the **absolute EBITDA + revenue trajectory inline**
    (a margin % can fall while absolute EBITDA RISES); a trailing multiple with NO forward counterpart
    carries a **'trailing-only — can't tell cheap-overshoot from cheap-terminal' blind-flag**; leverage is
    promoted to a **`survival_capacity`** block (net-debt/EBITDA + self-funding + nearest refinancing wall,
    any leg UNKNOWN = a risk). **(B) Synthesis contract** adds a required **`evidence_balance`** (committed,
    possibly-lopsided — no laundering a one-sided case into a balanced list), **opacity-as-signal** (a
    missing expected disclosure is a BEARISH risk, not neutral), and **contrarian-reconciliation** (each
    optical/trailing bear point must declare REAL-signal vs consensus-MISREAD using the paired reconciler).
    **(C) Guardrails FLAG (never block):** `UNRECONCILED` a margin-compression bear point lacking its
    absolute-EBITDA reconciliation; `FALSE-BALANCE` a 'mixed' read over a lopsided split; missing
    evidence_balance. *Verified — VRRM re-run, the proof case: the margin bear point flipped from
    "EBITDA margin 42%→37%" (face-value) to "largely an optical MISREAD — absolute EBITDA RISING 229→362
    while the % compressed"; evidence_balance committed ("mixed — FCF-positive/self-funding/growing… yet a
    >10%-customer Avis termination"); survival_capacity reads as one block (2.9x | self-funding | 2028 wall);
    no UNRECONCILED flag fired. 5 dossier-test pins added (margin reconciler, evidence_balance, opacity,
    UNRECONCILED + FALSE-BALANCE, survival block). ruff + mypy --strict (65) + pytest green.* *Post-audit
    (same day): margin_trend emitted as clean ';'-separated series — the old `‖ ABSOLUTE` block corrupted
    the frontend table parser (gross-margin row); `survival_capacity` + `evidence_balance` are now rendered
    in render.py + the frontend (the fix's output was hidden from the human); `_ABS_RECON` tightened (a bare
    "absolute"/"EBITDA <year>" no longer counts as reconciliation). Cohort re-run (2026-06-24) caught a
    truncation regression: a verbose `evidence_balance` in FIRST position starved the structural fields
    for data-rich names (FUBO/MVST returned UNAVAILABLE) — moved it LAST (a truncated last field is
    non-blocking, flag-not-block) + capped it concise (≤25 words) + synthesis max_tokens 8192→16384. All
    5 dossiers now assemble with a committed evidence_balance; BRBR/EPAM/FUBO/MVST re-run clean.*
    *False-balance made DIRECTION-AGNOSTIC + SYMMETRIC (2026-06-25): rule 7 rewritten so the BODY's weight
    must MATCH `evidence_balance` whether the name leans bull OR bear — the MAJORITY side complete, the
    MINORITY carrying ONLY genuine counter-points each sized-as-outweighed (never suppressed, never padded
    with neutral filler); + rule 7b (no-neutral-as-directional: a dossier-flagged unresolved fact counts as
    NEITHER bull nor bear — it belongs in `key_unknowns`). `FALSE-BALANCE` now ALSO fires on a committed
    STRONG lean over a near-symmetric body whose minority points aren't qualified-as-outweighed (the MVST
    defect — a 'strongly-bearish' label with a ~5-bull/6-bear body), via a new `_OUTWEIGHED` qualifier-cue.
    Verified — MVST re-run: dropping the neutral '0th-percentile' padding (5→4 bull, relocated to
    `key_unknowns`) left an honest 'mixed' read with the FCF counter-point SURVIVING qualified; the
    deterministic old-MVST shape (strong lean + unqualified symmetric body) fires the new flag; VRRM
    re-assembled clean (mixed, 6 bull/7 bear, no FALSE-BALANCE). Test pins BOTH a bearish and a bullish
    symmetric body; ruff + mypy --strict + pytest (197) green. PR #15 (#16 reverted the unrelated #14
    frontend collapse).* **NOT in
    scope (still deferred): the SIC peer-cohort / single-name cross-section read — a new capability, not a
    surgical fix.**
  - **Peer-comps read — the CIQ Company Comparable Analysis, FRAMED to RESIST the consensus comp
    (2026-06-24).** A sixth manual-CIQ kind (`comps`) + a `peer_comps` mechanical section
    (`ciq_sheets.peer_comps`): the peer ROSTER (each peer's cap + business + HQ), a market-cap-dispersion
    **comparability gate**, the name-vs-peer multiple spread (LTM + NTM forward; High/Low/Mean/Median), and
    the name-vs-peer **fundamental deltas** (growth/margin/leverage/beta). **NM preserved** as a real
    not-meaningful state (a negative base), distinct from a true-missing `–` (`_comps_cell` keeps NM where
    `clean_num` would drop it). The **Implied Valuation sheet is deliberately SKIPPED** (the consensus
    implied-upside trap; Valuation Chart is empty). Three EV/EBITDA concepts stay distinctly namespaced —
    screen `Fundamentals.ev_ebitda` (dead/UNKNOWN, `DataField[float]`), dossier `Valuation.ev_ebitda` (live
    single-name, `Sourced[float]`), the new `PeerComps.trading_multiples` (peer composite, `Sourced[str]`)
    — a structural test pins it. **Synthesis CONTRACT (system rule 10 + two guardrails):** the model POSES
    justified-vs-residual (is the discount EARNED — worse fundamentals — or RESIDUAL — an overshoot?),
    always WITH the peer-set composition, and reads a HETEROGENEOUS set as a confidence gate; it NEVER
    computes a residual, regresses, or emits an implied upside. `PEER-COMP-BARE` flags a cheap/rich-vs-peers
    verdict lacking decomposition/composition; `HETEROGENEOUS-BENCHMARK` flags a heterogeneous set read as a
    clean benchmark. *Verified — REAL licensed workbooks: VRRM (7 peers, 37x cap span → HETEROGENEOUS; name
    TEV/EBITDA 4.7 vs peer-median 10.3 reads "cheap," but LT EPS growth 2% vs 10% → the discount may be
    EARNED) + FUBO (10 peers, 642x span; NM preserved, true-missing `–` distinct). VRRM mechanical dossier
    assembles clean (the new REQUIRED field doesn't break assembly); namespacing distinct in real output
    (8.5x GAAP trailing / ~4.4x fwd-adj / 4.7x peer composite); no regression (all other sections populated).
    VRRM LIVE synthesis: the peer-comps bull points POSED "whether this gap is EARNED or RESIDUAL is the
    human's call, not a clean discount" + named the heterogeneous set + surfaced the confidence gate in
    key_unknowns — the new guardrails did NOT fire (the prompt steered it; they are the safety net). 8
    dossier-test pins (field present; roster+descriptions+deltas; NM; 3-way namespacing; render section; 2
    synthesis guardrails + a precision regression). ruff + mypy --strict (65) + pytest (196 offline) green.*
    *Post-build read-only AUDIT + precision fix (2026-06-24): required-field-meets-missing-input PROVEN
    graceful (VRRM mechanical with its comps file removed → peer_comps all MISSING fail-loud, assembly clean,
    no regression; file restored); no-verdict + serialisation + AST guards confirmed NON-vacuous (PeerComps
    is reachable, 0 forbidden field-names, comps consumes exactly its 4 declared sheets); namespacing distinct
    under missing data. ONE finding — the two new guardrails could false-fire on quality/brand
    'premium/rich/discount + noun' and the plural 'margins' — FIXED by NARROWING _REL_VAL_CUE to valuation
    constructions + PLURALISING _DECOMP_REF (regression-pinned). VRRM LIVE re-run post-fix: the model's
    peer-comp points decomposed EARNED-vs-RESIDUAL + named the heterogeneous set → both new guardrails
    correctly SILENT. KNOWN (separate, not addressed): the PRE-EXISTING ANCHORS-ON-DISTORTED-P/E flag now
    fires 3x on VRRM (incl. on a well-formed peer-comp decomposition that cites the distorted-basis P/E) — the
    comps feature amplifies that existing flag; it's conservative human-review, not a block.* *Frontend
    readability (2026-06-24): the peer-comps composites (roster / trading-multiples / fundamental-deltas) now
    render as scannable TABLES in the dossier viewer (parse-with-fallback to the plain fact() line, the same
    discipline as seriesTable — never breaks, never alters a value); comparability stays prose; the name
    column is a focal highlight and the deltas carry NO better/worse colour (the earned-vs-residual call is
    the human's, not the UI's). Verified live on VRRM (3 tables, real comp set) + parsers unit-checked
    (NM / '–' preserved, malformed → fallback).* **Does NOT close the SIC
    peer-cohort / graph-cohort known-unknown — that is the EDGAR-derived AUTOMATED cross-section, a separate
    deferred capability; this is the MANUAL CIQ comp set, and a heterogeneous peer set is itself surfaced as
    a confidence gate, not silently trusted.**
  - **EDGAR fundamentals fallback — fills EMPTY CIQ fundamentals from XBRL; CIQ multiples stay
    PRIMARY (2026-06-25).** ~10 of the top-20 Edge-2 finalists ship a CIQ Financials export whose
    Income Statement / Balance Sheet / Cash Flow subsheets are header-only (present-but-data-empty)
    while the Comparable-Analysis Trading Multiples ARE populated. New `edgar_fundamentals` module +
    a per-field hook in `assemble_mechanical`: when a CIQ fundamentals field is UNKNOWN (empty
    subsheet) AND a CIQ multiples signal is PRESENT (Financials→Multiples and/or the comps Trading
    Multiples — either proves the workbook is pulled), `free_cash_flow` / `margin_trend` /
    `multi_year_trajectory` derive from EDGAR companyfacts (REUSING `concepts.extract_points`, no new
    XBRL layer). Fail-loud: **EBITDA = operating_income + aligned D&A** — a name with op-income but
    ZERO D&A datapoints (CNXC) yields **EBITDA UNKNOWN, never op-income alone** (mirrors
    `fundamental_snapshot`); FCF = OCF − capex. Each EDGAR field's `source_ref` reads `EDGAR XBRL
    companyfacts <tag> [period]` (NOT a CIQ ref) — provenance honest + visible. `_prefer_ciq` NEVER
    overrides a PRESENT CIQ field (multiples primary). The ONE cross-source risk is localized:
    EDGAR-derived fundamentals → `peer_comps.fundamental_deltas` carries an "EDGAR-GAAP basis vs peers
    CIQ basis — a delta may be definitional" flag; `trading_multiples` (CIQ-vs-CIQ) is NOT flagged,
    nor is it a blanket dossier flag. *Verified — REAL run on AORT (CIQ fundamentals empty, comps
    Multiples populated): the trigger fired; the 3 fields populated from EDGAR with EDGAR source_refs
    (revenue FY2018→FY2025 180→354 $M, an 8y EBITDA-margin series, FCF $0.8M); CIQ trading_multiples
    unchanged; 5/6 quality fundamentals now PRESENT (only interest_coverage UNKNOWN — needs an
    interest_expense alias, out of scope); fundamental_deltas carries the basis flag, trading_multiples
    does not. CNXC fail-loud (EBITDA UNKNOWN, Revenue+FCF still derive) proven by a deterministic test.
    ruff + mypy --strict (66) + pytest (201 offline) green; 5 dossier-test pins (trigger; full-coverage
    fields + EDGAR refs; EBITDA fail-loud/CNXC; cross-source flag on fundamental_deltas only).*
    *Follow-on fixes (2026-06-25, verified on AORT + regression-pinned). ROOT CAUSE (corrected after a
    wrong first pass — see git history): AORT's Financials_Quarterly export has an EMPTY Income
    Statement whose verbatim 'Period Type:' boilerplate reads 'Annual', so `period_type` mis-tagged the
    QUARTERLY workbook 'annual' and `workbook(freq='quarterly')` silently fell back to the Annual
    workbook (annual Multiples). Fix: `_financials_freq` makes the FILENAME ('…_Quarterly' / '…_Annual')
    authoritative, using `period_type` only for an un-named export. Now `freq='quarterly'` resolves to
    the Quarterly workbook → `ev_ebitda` reads the QUARTERLY 'For Quarter Ending' Multiples (18.4x over
    20 quarterly closes → 0%ile near-floor), was dark; and `module_present('Financials — Quarterly')`
    reads True, so the stale 'pull CIQ' flag is gone at the root (no manifest_flags change needed).
    Separately, frontend `seriesTable` sorts period columns chronologically (a `periodKey` year*13+month
    key) so uneven EDGAR sub-series render FY11→FY25, not out-of-order. (The fundamentals stay
    EDGAR-filled — both financials Income Statements are empty.) ruff + mypy --strict (66) + pytest +
    node --check green.* *Code-review audit (high-effort, multi-agent, PR #20) hardened 5 edge cases:
    EBITDA/FCF now require period_start match (not just period_end — a fiscal-year-transition stub
    would have summed mismatched spans); the cross-source flag keys on the RESOLVED fields actually
    used (no false warning when CIQ wins every field); `_companyfacts_or_none` also swallows ValueError
    (a non-numeric CIK → pad_cik int()); `_financials_freq` anchors on the '_quarterly'/'_annual' token
    (a company NAME can't false-match); `flag_deltas_basis` is a no-op on an absent delta. +3 test pins
    (freq-from-filename, EBITDA period_start, companyfacts-ValueError); pytest (204 offline) green.*
    **Out of scope (still
    owed): the CNXC D&A alias-list extension; CIQ normalized/adjusted figures (not derivable from raw
    XBRL).**
  - **CIQ loader → workbook-aware addressing model (VRRM, 2026-06-19) — the prior loader couldn't
    reach the subsheets, so every CIQ section read MISSING.** CIQ Financials is ONE ~13-subsheet
    workbook (Income Statement / Cash Flow / Multiples / Segments / Capital Structure Details / …);
    Estimates is its own; **Multiples lives in BOTH** (historical in Financials, forward in Estimates).
    The old filename-keyword `module→file` match never opened a subsheet. New model: each module
    resolves to an explicit **(workbook-kind, sheet-name) ADDRESS** via one accessor
    (`bundle.sheet(kind, name, freq)` → rows or fail-loud `CiqUnavailableError`); adding a consumer =
    register an address + write its extractor, no loader re-architecture. **`xlrd` added** so legacy
    `.xls` (BIFF) parses. Per-sheet reading rules bound to the sheet: partial-period **last column
    excluded** from the Multiples history but used as "current"; **Reclassified boundary** never
    YoY'd across; frequency read **verbatim** from Income Statement "Period Type", never shape-
    inferred; empty / `-` / `Entitlement Needed` all → UNAVAILABLE; per-sheet date formats (string /
    Excel-serial / datetime). The four formerly hard-MISSING fields now extract: **free_cash_flow,
    ev_ebitda_percentile_5y, interest_coverage, liquidity_covenant_flags**. **Transcripts** module
    added: earnings-call files are Word-disguised-as-`.rtf` (OLE) → routed through LibreOffice/Word,
    NOT striprtf; fed as a **qualitative** input only (no numbers derived). *Verified: VRRM re-run —
    segments PRESENT (Commercial Services 436/45%, Parking 83/8%, Government 461/47% of 979),
    EV/EBITDA (TEV/LTM) 8.5x at the 0%ile of 19 closes, FCF 53.9, EBITDA-margin 37%, interest-cov
    5.6x, term-loan/notes liquidity table, EPS rev 1↑/5↓ & revenue 0↑/8↓, customers — all PRESENT and
    source-bound; geographic UNKNOWN (section present, extractor not wired) and transcript UNKNOWN
    (LibreOffice not installed) — honest fail-loud, not fabricated. 6 new workbook tests (subsheet
    routing finds Multiples+Segments inside Financials; partial-col exclusion; Reclassified guard;
    blank/`-`/Entitlement→UNAVAILABLE; missing-workbook MISSING vs absent-sheet UNKNOWN).*
  - **Silent-misread reconciliation (VRRM, 2026-06-19) — extraction can be wrong without failing
    loud; checked extracted-vs-known-correct, fixed 3, flagged 1.** The fail-loud path can't catch a
    value that parses but means the wrong thing. (1) **Segment EBITDA now surfaced** — the Segments
    sheet's EBITDA section parses to exact figures but only Revenues was read; the dossier showed
    Commercial Services at **45% of revenue** while hiding that it is **~68% of EBITDA** (Avis sits
    in the profit-concentrated segment). Added `segment_ebitda` (same `_segment_section`,
    `section="EBITDA"`); render BOTH revenue-share and EBITDA-share; it reaches the synthesis (the
    bear case now cites "68% of segment EBITDA vs 45% of revenue"). (2) **Margin YoY LTM-vs-FY guard**
    — the revenue YoY was dividing LTM-ending-Mar-2026 by FY-Dec-2025 and printing "+0%", a silent
    period mix (notes ~line 204); added an LTM/FY guard beside the Reclassified guard → now
    "UNAVAILABLE (LTM-vs-FY period mix)"; single-column margins (gross 57%, EBITDA 37%) unchanged.
    (3) **EV/EBITDA dollar-scalar fixed** — `valuation.ev_ebitda` rendered **352,494,000** because
    `screens/assemble.py:162` feeds it `snap.ebitda_annual` (EBITDA dollars) into a multiple-named
    field; the dossier now sources the **CIQ TEV/LTM multiple (8.5x)** via `ev_ebitda_current`, never
    the EDGAR scalar. **Root cause also fixed at the producer** (separate commit): `assemble.py:162`
    no longer writes EBITDA dollars into `ev_ebitda` — the field was always meant to hold the
    (deferred, never-built) **EV/EBITDA multiple**, so it now defers to UNKNOWN ("needs net-debt/EV"),
    matching its percentile sibling. **No rename / no snapshot migration / no alias** — a bare rename
    would have broken the 301 committed `candidate_records.jsonl` (required key, strict-parsed by the
    dossier/ranker/CLI loaders); verified both legacy-float and new-UNKNOWN parse under the unchanged
    `DataField[float]` schema, +2 regression tests (producer defers; committed snapshot still loads).
    (4) **Adjusted-EPS — FLAGGED, not built** (LibreOffice still absent): two flags
    now fire — the surfaced EPS is GAAP-based and the company-adjusted (~1.35) figure lives in the
    transcript/earnings-release reconciliation (UNAVAILABLE); and the EDGAR P/E (5.5x) **conflicts
    ~3× with the CIQ P/LTM EPS (16.8x)** because the EDGAR trailing EPS is one-time-inflated — the
    synthesis must not anchor on 5.5x as "cheap" (it still cites it; the flag is the human's guard).
    (4b) **Leverage-basis — FLAGGED** (same GAAP-vs-adjusted theme): net debt/EBITDA reads **2.9x on
    consolidated GAAP EBITDA**, but management/credit-covenants define leverage on **adjusted EBITDA**
    (larger denominator → ~2.5x); the adjusted-EBITDA reconciliation is in the release/transcript
    (UNAVAILABLE), so the covenant-basis ratio isn't surfaced — flag only, not re-sourced (the
    adjusted measure is not the CIQ segment-sum and isn't in the Financials workbook). *Verified on
    VRRM (4 flags fire) + 3 new regression tests (segment-EBITDA share, LTM/FY YoY guard, ev_ebitda is
    a multiple).*
  - **Completeness + presentation pass (VRRM, 2026-06-20) — retrieval/formatting, no judgement.** Four
    mechanical gaps closed; the assemble-not-conclude line and the loud flags are untouched. (1)
    **Ex-99.1 revised-guidance fetch** — the catalyst 8-K body only *points* to the press release
    ("furnished as Exhibit 99.1"); the assembler now follows the filing index to the 99.1 doc, and
    surfaces the company's **revised full-year guidance VERBATIM, source-bound** (new
    `DrawdownCause.revised_guidance`). For VRRM: revenue **$985–995M / adj-EBITDA $380–385M / adj-EPS
    $1.19–1.25 / FCF $140–150M**, bound to the exhibit URL — the single most decision-relevant number,
    previously absent. Verbatim only (no number-parsing → no mis-extraction); fail-loud UNKNOWN with
    the accession if the exhibit/section is absent. (2) **Transcript dependency met + WIDENED** —
    installed LibreOffice (`soffice`, brew-symlinked onto PATH) so the existing `ole_disguised`→soffice
    `read_text` path runs; `management_commentary` skips the boilerplate (S&P estimates table / dotted
    TOC / operator intro / forward-looking-statements legalese) by anchoring at the IR's hand-off to
    management, and surfaces the call's **SUBSTANCE in full — prepared remarks AND Q&A** (cap raised
    1.5k→80k; token economy, not principle). VRRM: 40k/44k chars surfaced, including the CEO's
    pre-termination "ongoing and **constructive**" framing of the >10% Avis renewal AND the Q&A
    renegotiation exchange — verdict-relevant context the human reads and judges. The machine only
    WIDENS the window; it never curates/labels the 'relevant' passage. Qualitative, no numbers derived.
    (One consequence, noted: a wide transcript enlarges the synthesis number-trace haystack — more
    spoken figures become traceable; acceptable, the transcript is source-bound mechanical content.) (3) **Render-boundary formatting standard** — screen-DataField floats are
    formatted for legibility **at render only** (`_mult`→"2.9x", `_pctile`→"1st %ile", `_pct`→"−78.7%",
    `_signword`→"positive"); **the stored `Sourced.value` keeps full precision** so the synthesis /
    number-trace still see the real number (a fenced, asserted invariant). CIQ string fields stay
    clean at extraction; `consensus_view` now labels mean/median, shows LT-growth as a percent, and
    explains the "Buy (1.00)" CIQ score. (4) **Customers parsed** — the Business-Relationships RTF is
    parsed into readable `Name — Type · Industry · src` lines (Avis/Enterprise/NYC-DOT/Hertz for
    VRRM), not a raw pipe-dump; fail-loud UNKNOWN if the table can't be parsed. *Verified end-to-end
    on the VRRM dossier.md + 7 new offline tests (99.1 extractor & name-matcher, render formatters &
    the precision fence, customers parse, transcript skip-boilerplate & carry-Q&A).* **Record-only
    (not acted on):** the
    graph-cohort ~4% caveat (next bullet) stands; the screen still tags every gap-down
    `earnings_gap_down` (the dossier relabels by 8-K item code at surface — upstream cosmetic); the
    screen's `ev_ebitda` dollar-field was already fixed separately (deferred to UNKNOWN, the dossier
    sources the CIQ multiple).
  - **Final extraction batch (VRRM, 2026-06-20) — surface data already in the inputs; no judgement,
    no value changes.** Five gaps closed; the assemble-not-conclude line + loud flags hold. (1)
    **Adjusted-basis multiples + leverage** — the 99.1 revised guidance (adj-EBITDA $380–385M, adj-EPS
    $1.19–1.25) now feeds, source-bound: forward **EV/adj-EBITDA ~4.5x** (current EV ÷ FY-guide
    adj-EBITDA) and covenant-basis **net-debt/adj-EBITDA ~2.6x**, ALONGSIDE the GAAP TEV/LTM 8.5x and
    GAAP 2.9x; plus adjusted EPS (adj P/E ~3.9x). With the adjusted basis now SHOWN, the two GAAP
    caveats **downgrade from open flags to resolved facts** ("EPS-understates" + "leverage-covenant-
    UNAVAILABLE" drop); the "P/E distorted by non-recurring EPS" and "EDGAR-vs-CIQ P/E conflict" flags
    are KEPT. Fail-loud: only figures actually in the 99.1 are used; missing → the caveat stays. EV =
    EOD price×shares + EDGAR net-debt; adj-EBITDA from the 99.1. (2) **Geographic segments wired** — the
    Segments 'Geographic Segments → Revenues' block now parses (VRRM 86% US), same code as business
    segments (`_segment_section(after_label=…)`). (3) **Revenue YoY from the quarterly file** — the
    annual file's only clean comparison is LTM-vs-FY (both guards refuse); the quarterly Income
    Statement gives a clean same-quarter YoY (Q1-2026 vs Q1-2025 = **+0.1%**, same-basis), guards
    intact. (4) **Multi-year trajectory** — the 5y arc (revenue 551→979, EBITDA 229→362, segment
    EBITDA, ROIC 5.1%→11.5%) surfaced per-period with the Reclassified basis marked, NEVER YoY'd across
    — the compounder-vs-melting-ice signal (VRRM was *growing* pre-Avis). (5) **ROIC + surprise** — ROIC
    arc folded into the trajectory (Ratios sheet); **annual** estimate surprise from Estimates→Surprise
    (EPS beat→miss: FY23 −32%, FY24 −76% — the pre-Avis crack; the sheet has no quarterly view, so it's
    fiscal-year). *Verified on the VRRM dossier.md + 4 new offline tests (adjusted parse & flag-
    downgrade, geographic, quarterly YoY with guards, trajectory respecting Reclassified). A synthetic
    test caught a real regex bug (the adj-figure pattern swallowed a trailing '.') — fixed.* **DID NOT
    (verified redundant/immaterial/working-as-designed):** Key Stats / Hist-Capitalization /
    Cap-Structure-Summary / Pension-OPEB / Supplemental / Industry-Specific sheets; directional-lint
    refine (fires on quoted consensus, glance-and-clear); quarterly consensus point estimates;
    transcript summary (deliberately raw).
  - **Label-integrity pass (VRRM, 2026-06-20) — values correct, labels imprecise; recomputation only,
    no new extraction.** (1) **"Margin trend" is now the gross/EBITDA-margin TRAJECTORY** across the
    years (VRRM's 42%→37% EBITDA-margin compression visible), not single-period levels; the revenue
    YoY (a top-line metric) MOVED out of the margin field into the multi-year trajectory/growth line.
    (2) **EBITDA-basis reconciliation** — segment EBITDA shares are now explicitly "% of
    segment-EBITDA sum (pre-corporate) 416", with the **consolidated EBITDA 362 (~54 unallocated
    corporate)** surfaced, so the two 'EBITDA' bases (segment-sum behind the shares vs consolidated
    behind the multiples/leverage/coverage) are distinguishable, not silently mixed. (3) **P/E-
    distortion flag RESOLVED in-pipeline** — now that the forward adjusted EPS is sourced, the open
    "verify against forward EPS" flag becomes a resolved statement: trailing GAAP P/E 5.5x is
    one-time-distorted (GAAP EPS 0.85 ~3.1× the 0.28 median), clean read = forward adjusted $1.19–1.25
    → ~3.9x; the EDGAR-vs-CIQ P/E conflict folds into it (no longer a separate open flag). (4) **Minor
    labels** — net-debt/adj-EBITDA "(adjusted, covenant)" → **"(fwd-adj)"** (it uses forward, not
    trailing, EBITDA); the Surprise line tagged **GAAP-EPS basis** (vs the 99.1 adjusted guide). The
    final flag set: 1 RESOLVED-P/E statement + the synthesis guardrail flags. *Verified on VRRM; 3
    margin tests updated (margin_trend is a trajectory; revenue YoY lives in the trajectory;
    quarterly-YoY refuses a cross-basis prior). DID NOT change any correct value, refine the
    directional/twin/number-trace guards (working-as-designed), or add sheets.*
  - **Synthesis truncation fix + transcript redesign (VRRM, 2026-06-21) — SUPERSEDES the 80k full
    transcript embed above.** A run dropped the last two synthesis fields (decisive_question,
    key_unknowns) as BLANK: the model hit `max_tokens` mid-tool-call (the mech layer had grown to
    56.5k chars, ~40k of it the embedded transcript), and two silent-failure points let it pass —
    `llm.extract` ignored `stop_reason`, and `synthesize`/`_parse` defaulted the missing required
    fields. Three fixes: **(1) FAIL LOUD on truncation** — `extract` now raises `LlmError` when
    `stop_reason=="max_tokens"`, and `synthesize` rejects any raw output missing a required field
    (the tool marks all five required) → the synthesis is marked **UNAVAILABLE** with a loud flag,
    never a blank indistinguishable from genuine absence. **(2) Output cap 4096→8192.** **(3)
    Transcript redesign — the machine POINTS, never embeds-full or curates:** the dossier
    `management_commentary` is now a **pointer** to the call file ("read in full for posture/tone",
    source-bound; ~210 chars), and the synthesis gets a separate **mechanically-bounded** slice
    (`transcript_for_synthesis`: boilerplate-stripped, prepared-remarks + Q&A to a 12k char budget) —
    a structural cut (sections + budget), NOT a topic/relevance selection, name-agnostic. This removes
    the bloat at the root (mech layer 56.5k→14.2k) and tightens the number-trace (the transcript is no
    longer in the mech dump). *Verified on VRRM: pointer not embed, all 5 synthesis fields populate
    (decisive_question + 3/3 evidence + 10 key_unknowns), grounded bull/bear from the bounded input;
    +3 offline tests (truncated tool response → UNAVAILABLE not blank; extract raises on max_tokens;
    management_commentary is a pointer).*
  - **Synthesis model → Opus 4.8 (groundedness benchmark, 2026-06-23).** Sonnet-4.6 vs Opus-4.8 on the
    dossier synthesis: same names, same mechanical facts (model-independent), only the synthesis model
    varied; measured FAITHFULNESS via the guardrail flags (untraceable / uncited / mis-cite / directional),
    NOT "better take" (the synthesis doesn't conclude — that is the human's). 4 CIQ names (BRBR, EPAM,
    VRRM, MVST) × 2 runs each → **Opus 1.25 untraceable-figures/dossier vs Sonnet 4.0 (~⅓), 0 mis-cites
    vs 0.75, ~half the total flags, and 3.5× more run-to-run stable** (|r1−r2| mean 1.0 vs 3.5). Gap
    widest on the thin-fact name (MVST: Sonnet invented 11 figures/run, Opus 1–2). Coverage slightly
    lower (Opus ~7.9 bull-pts vs 9.5) but far more grounded per claim. **Decision: `graph_llm_model`
    default flipped `claude-sonnet-4-6` → `claude-opus-4-8` (`config.py`)** — a dossier's job is to feed
    the human FAITHFUL source-bound facts, not to be exhaustive; cost/latency higher, acceptable at
    ~10 dossiers/week. *First cut (n=4×2); the robust signals (total flags, untraceable, stability) all
    favoured Opus. Re-measure if the synthesis prompt/inputs change materially.*
  - **⚠ LANDMINE (unbuilt — insider/Form-4):** when insider data is wired, the CIQ **Transaction-Type
    direction-flip** (`ciq_extraction_notes` ~line 80) MUST be handled — the Type column signs the
    trade, so a naive `net_shares_sold` summed off raw quantities is **sign-flip wrong** (buys and
    sells counted with one sign). High-severity: it would invert the insider-flow read. No insider
    extractor exists yet — this is a warning for whoever builds it.
  - **Graph-cohort coverage caveat (report-only):** only **~4% (11/301)** of the ranked candidates are
    in `graph_coverage.json` (built on a narrow slice, not the candidate universe) — so the
    idiosyncratic-vs-shared **graph-cohort read is effectively dormant at the dossier stage**; 96%
    (incl. FUBO, VRRM) fall back to the name-vs-IWM read with cohort UNKNOWN. Activating it needs the
    graph built across the candidate universe — deferred, not rebuilt.
- **Decision ledger** (`vinci/ledger` + `store`) — append-only: `append_ledger` is INSERT-only and
  **no `clear_ledger`/ledger-DELETE exists anywhere** — *2 verdicts across 2 processes both persist;
  survives `clear_candidates`+`clear_universe`+`export_snapshots`; re-log → `sqlite3.IntegrityError`.*
  - **FIRST REAL VERDICT LOGGED — 2026-06-21.** `VRRM` **AVOID_TERMINAL**, frozen entry **$4.71 @
    2026-06-17** (last settled close ≤ the Sunday decision date; PRESENT, 4d old — NOT the $4.44 a live
    quote showed, surfaced to the PM before writing since the store stops at 06-17), horizon **180d**
    (resolves ~2026-12-18), benchmark IWM. The PM's rationale is source-bound in the entry: thesis =
    the Avis-termination → cascading-RAC-channel-exit structural-break case; twin ruled out = Conduent
    (lost-NJMVC analogue); explicit kill-criteria. Committed to `decision_ledger.jsonl`. **This is
    leg 1 of the BUY−AVOID spread — unresolved; 0 resolved verdicts, so the §4 gate is NOT met.** The
    spread needs BUY legs and calendar time before it can show anything.
- **Scoring harness** (`vinci/scoring`) — BUY−AVOID spread = `buy_mean_return − avoid_mean_return`
  (benchmark-free), over **resolved** verdicts only — *synthetic +20% BUY / −20% AVOID → spread +40%.*
  - **Per-sector spread enabler — verdicts sector-tagged at log time (built 2026-06-22).** Every
    `LedgerEntry` now carries a `sector` (coarse GICS-like, `vinci/sectors.sector_for_sic` over the
    EDGAR SIC the resolver already provides — **NO new data source**), captured + frozen at log time
    like the entry price, never derived later. `log_verdict` resolves the SIC via the resolver
    (`Identity.sic` is not populated on candidates) through a `SicSource` Protocol that keeps the
    ledger decoupled + testable; `sector` rides in the entry payload JSON, so **no SQLite migration**.
    **Behavior note:** this adds one **cached** EDGAR `submissions` lookup at log time (1-day TTL) —
    logging a verdict (previously fully offline) now needs that fetch to succeed; fail-loud if it
    can't, consistent with the ethos. Not a real-candidate blocker: the operating-co gate guarantees
    every candidate has a CIK (VRRM resolved SIC 4700 → Industrials live); only CIK-less benchmark
    ETFs would raise, and those are never candidates.
    The harness reads it: `scoring.spread_by_sector` returns a per-sector BUY−AVOID spread that is
    **`sufficient=False` ("insufficient data") until a sector has ≥2 resolved BUYs AND ≥2 AVOIDs** —
    honest emptiness, never a spread off a one-name leg; `ScoreReport.by_sector` + the report markdown
    surface it. **VRRM (logged 2026-06-21, pre-feature) reads back `sector=None` — the immutable entry
    is NOT rewritten;** it is the one untagged verdict and buckets under "Unknown" (no backfill, no
    silent edit — the honest option (b)). *Verified: `sector_for_sic` maps 7372→Technology,
    2834/3841→Health Care, 1311/2911→Energy, 6022→Financials, 6798→Real Estate, 5812→Consumer
    Discretionary, blank/None→Unknown; a logged verdict carries + round-trips its sector; the real
    ledger's per-sector read is empty (0 resolved) honestly. +2 tests (a verdict carries its sector;
    the spread groups by sector + stays insufficient until both legs are real, untagged→"Unknown").
    ruff + `mypy --strict` clean; suite green.* This is the cheap enabler the §6 sector-expertise
    scoping question needs **in place before data accrues** — the scoping DECISION stays open + data-
    gated (§6).
- **Entry-price freeze** (`store.close_as_of`) — clamps to `bar_date ≤ reference_date`, fail-loud if
  none, staleness kept on top — *Phase-0 lookahead fix; 3 shown cases + regression test; commit
  `a3b63bb` on `main` (orig `b9d438d`, rebased).*
- **graph-exposure** (`vinci/graph/exposure`, `graph-exposure` CLI) — given an entity, returns N-hop
  exposed names with 10-K provenance — *`--entity TSM` → 32 names within 2 hops (incl. Apple via
  Cirrus); unit test. This is research-input only — see §3.*
- **GitHub Actions cron** (`.github/workflows/weekly-screen.yml`, `monthly-score.yml`) — present.
  *Manual trigger preferred for now.*
- **Read-only ops dashboard** (`frontend/`, static; `frontend/build.py` snapshot mirror) — a
  no-backend viewer over the COMMITTED snapshots: overview + the **validation-gate spread** (honest
  0-resolved), ingestion/universe health, the overshoot screen, the **ranked queue with per-name
  structural profiles**, the `graph-exposure` cross-section (research-input), the per-finalist
  **dossier** (assembles-not-concludes), and the decision log; capital-stage views (sizing / execution
  / monitoring) shown **locked** until the gate clears. **Renders only — never trades, writes, or logs
  a verdict** (vanilla ES modules, hash routing, runtime fetch). `build.py` mirrors the lightweight
  snapshots + (locally) the DERIVED dossiers + graph into a **git-ignored** mirror, regenerated every
  build. **Merged to main CODE-ONLY (PR #3, `bb3dbae`, 2026-06-22):** committed = frontend source +
  non-licensed snapshots (ranked_queue, ledger, universe_stats); the DERIVED `dossier.json` +
  `graph_coverage.json` stay **git-ignored / local-only** and raw CIQ is never committed — held for the
  separately-gated deploy step (§4 CONDITIONAL). *Verified locally: `build.py` mirrored 301 queue /
  1,727 universe / FUBO+VRRM dossiers / 339-edge graph; served on `:8731` → overview, dossier (full
  VRRM), and graph all render against local data, no console errors.* **No deploy is wired** —
  Cloudflare is unconnected (0 GitHub deployments / environments / webhooks), so the merge deployed
  nothing.
  - **Frontend eager-load / memory fix (2026-06-24):** the OVERVIEW landing page was fetching +
    parsing the full ~440 KB `ranked_queue.jsonl` just to show two counts, and `manifest`/`ledger` were
    each fetched TWICE (the caches stored the resolved VALUE, so concurrent `Promise.all` callers
    raced). Fixed: `build.py` emits the queue counts into `manifest.json` (the ~200-byte index) → the
    overview reads them there and **no longer loads the queue** (it loads lazily only on the Ranker);
    the snapshot loaders now memoize the in-flight PROMISE (`_once`) so concurrent callers share one
    fetch. *Verified via fresh-module import (the live tab's ES-module cache is stale, like the
    screenshot tooling this session): `getUniverseHealth().queue = {total 317, demoted 47}` from the
    manifest, 0 ranked_queue fetches, and 2 concurrent manifest/ledger calls → 1 fetch each; landing-
    page data ~447 KB → ~4 KB, overview heap roughly halves. NO leak existed — heap was 2–4 MB, stable
    across 24 navigations; the Ranker's 318-row table is the heaviest DOM, and OS-process memory is the
    per-tab renderer baseline, not this app.* All 5 dossiers were re-assembled so each carries
    peer_comps (now rendered as TABLES, NM preserved); BRBR's 'premium brand' drew 0 peer-comp
    guardrail false-fires (the narrowed _REL_VAL_CUE held live).
- _Whole suite green (ruff + mypy --strict clean; `pytest -m "not network"` passes)._

## 3. FALSIFIED — tested and retired (NOT deferred)

**The fossils call the graph "the differentiator." That is wrong, and recorded honestly here:**

- **Edge 3 / graph-as-mechanical-signal (shock-propagation): FALSIFIED.** Test 1 (`vinci/graph/test1`,
  `scripts/run_test1*.py`) returned **two clean nulls on the sector-deconfounded column**: same-sector
  semis (signal vanished after SOXX-adjustment); cross-sector (live pooled −1.0% vs own-sector, while
  the control AMZN posted +1.0% — *that was the n≈8–16 noise floor*; the apparent vs-IWM signal was
  beta). Retired for **three independent reasons**: (1) null on the data, twice; (2) supply-chain
  momentum is a ~17-yr-old published, arbitraged anomaly → **replicable**, fails the
  hard-to-replicate first principle; (3) the only direction it hinted at was a **short on illiquid
  small-caps** — untradeable for a long-biased mandate.
- **What survives:** the graph as a **research-input lookup** (`graph-exposure`) for the human
  discriminator. It gates nothing and makes no trade decision. Validated **operationally** (vs a
  hand-built baseline on a live event), never statistically — so it can't be data-mined.

## 4. Deferred — CAPITAL-gated on the spread; BUILD per the GOVERNOR

**GATE — disciplined on CAPITAL, flexible on BUILD.** No real capital deploys on an edge until its
**BUY−AVOID spread validates the discriminator** — ≥2 quarters of *resolved* verdicts, positive and
large enough to be real, not noise (the hard rule, unchanged). But validation has weeks-to-quarters
latency; single-threading the BUILD wastes it and is wrong for a fund growing LP capital on finite
runway. Building toward AND forward-validating multiple edges in PARALLEL is correct — each accrues its
own spread, capital deploys on whichever validates first; this is NOT the premature-investment trap
(that trap is real CAPITAL on an unproven edge, never parallel build). **THE GOVERNOR:** start the next
edge in parallel ONLY when (a) it has a specified validation design and (b) it does not starve the
overshoot loop of verdicts — "next edge, validation-design-first, without diluting the lead loop,"
never "build everything"; the 2-person failure mode is spreading thin and validating nothing. **Lead
horse unchanged:** overshoot is the most-validatable edge; parallel work runs WHILE its verdicts
resolve, not instead — the binding constraint on proving anything is still resolved verdicts.
*Verified absent from the repo today* (no execution/sizing/portfolio/monitoring modules; only
`SourceTier.IBKR` labels in schemas).

**FIRST WAVE — unlocked directly by a positive spread** (capital-deployment machinery for the *proven*
Edge-2 — gated by definition, not parallel-buildable; turns the loop into real money):
1. **Position sizing / risk / portfolio construction** — trigger: spread positive. First, because you
   can't size until you know the edge is real, and sizing precedes execution.
2. **Execution (IBKR)** — trigger: sizing built **+** spread positive **+** the regulatory gate (§6,
   SFC Type 9) clear for real money. Hard-deferred; paper until all three.
3. **Monitoring / thesis-break / decay** — trigger: live positions exist (i.e. after execution).

**SECOND WAVE — widen the funnel** (buildable in PARALLEL per §4's GOVERNOR — validation-design-first,
without starving the lead loop; each becomes a *real* widener only when its OWN spread validates):
4. **Edge 1 (orphaned quality) screen** — buildable in parallel per the governor (validation design =
   its own BUY−AVOID spread); real capital still waits on that spread. Reuses the same ranker +
   dossier-assembler on a different (neglect-based, not drawdown-based) screen — the strongest expansion.
5. **Active event-detection feeding `graph-exposure`** — buildable in parallel per the governor
   (validation design = the event-assembly obvious/non-obvious test, ledger below); gated only on not
   starving the lead loop. An alerting layer on the existing lookup (**not** the falsified mechanical
   screen) — surfaces exposed cross-sections to the human on a real event; decides nothing.

**CONDITIONAL — only if separately earned** (not gated on the spread):
- **Cloudflare deploy + licensed-artifact commit (LATER-STAGE; the dashboard is built + merged
  code-only, §2).** Stand up the GitHub→Cloudflare Pages auto-deploy **with Cloudflare Access (authed)**
  and commit the DERIVED `dossier.json` + `graph_coverage.json` to the private repo (add the targeted
  `.gitignore` exceptions; raw CIQ stays ignored). **Two hard gates before any licensed data is served
  — BLOCKER A:** prove the deployed URL rejects an unauthenticated request (no-cred / incognito fetch
  returns an Access challenge, not content) — the irreversible gate, since once licensed data is served
  from a reachable URL it can't be retracted; **BLOCKER B:** confirm `graph_coverage.json` is CIQ-free
  (EDGAR-10-K relationship/exposure only — verified clean 2026-06-22: zero licensed financials, only
  verbatim 10-K evidence + graph counts). Trigger: operator go-ahead **after both blockers confirm**.
  Until then the dashboard is **local-only**; nothing is deployed (Cloudflare currently unconnected).
- **Verification harness (LLM bull/bear/judge)** — trigger: only if running the manual discriminator
  reveals it needs a structured bull/bear step. May never be needed; do not build speculatively.
- **Drive adapter for the dossier-assembler** — trigger: the local-folder assembler is proven and the
  manual export→folder step is the real friction. A convenience, not a milestone.
- **Close the ranker's coverage gaps** — wire **EV/EBITDA-pctile history** + **8-K/guidance TEXT
  events** (the latter also splits drawdown-character back into shape + cause and feeds the Tier-3
  LLM cause-pass, which then reads filing text instead of `LLM: —`). Trigger: **only if the gap
  proves to bite during real finalist selection** — i.e. the ~51% UNKNOWN-multiple names or the
  un-split character axis visibly distort the queue-top in use. **Monitor in use; don't chase
  preemptively** (the ranker already handles the gaps fail-loud — §2 coverage caveat).
- **Self-registering CIQ address registry (the dossier manifest's Option A) — named decision point,
  NOT a TODO.** Today `CIQ_MODULES` is **hand-maintained, drift-PROOFED by the AST coverage test**
  (§2: a new extractor consuming an undeclared kind fails the test → you declare it in the tuple).
  That is **correct while the assembler's input set is FIXED (the 6 CIQ modules)** — the tuple is small
  and the test catches every drift. (**`comps` peer-comps landed 2026-06-24 as the 1st new KIND** since
  this trigger was written — manifest stayed hand-maintained, per the "revisit at the 3rd new kind"
  call; not yet a migration.) **TRIGGER to migrate** to a registry where extractors declare
  their own `(kind, sheet, freq)` addresses (via decorator / co-located const) and **`CIQ_MODULES` is
  GENERATED, not mirrored**: when the assembler begins ingesting **NEW document KINDS as a deliberate
  direction** (e.g. `key_developments`, litigation, new filing types, alt-data). At that point the
  hand-maintained tuple becomes a maintenance tax that scales with source count, and the registry
  inverts it so a new extractor registers itself. **Do NOT build it preemptively — build it when the
  2nd or 3rd new kind lands and the pattern is real.** Until then the AST guard is the binding.

### Edge-hypothesis ledger — the full inventory (record-only doc; the edges are gated, built per §4's GOVERNOR)

The coherent record of every edge hypothesis considered, so the reasoning survives and a future
session neither re-litigates a dead one nor chases an unrecorded one. **The binding constraint is
proving Edge 2 (the empty spread). Parallel build toward another edge is allowed under §4's GOVERNOR
(validation-design-first, without starving overshoot's verdicts); what stays hard-gated on the spread
is real CAPITAL, not build.** Each carries an explicit status + (where testable) a KILL CRITERION.

**THE EDGE FILTER (the frame every hypothesis is judged against).** The fund's one edge is **deep
human judgment on a few finalists, fed by an AI funnel that achieves breadth a human can't** (§1,
CLAUDE.md). A candidate edge counts ONLY if it FEEDS that judgment — assembles, orders, cites, or
surfaces a cross-section for the human. The instant a hypothesis becomes "the machine's OUTPUT is the
decision" (a score/signal you trade), it has left the thesis and is the exact failure mode this
project exists to avoid. This is the line that keeps the falsified Edge-3 *signal* dead (§3) while
its *aggregation* form survives below: one concludes, the other feeds. Every entry is filtered by
this test.

**LIVE — being proven now: Edge 2 (overshoot de-rating).** The entire built funnel
(universe→screen→ranker→dossier→ledger) serves this one. Mispricing = an exaggerated-and-temporary
de-rating a human can name a reversal for, vs its terminal-decline twin. Status: **UNPROVEN** — the
BUY−AVOID spread is empty (one unresolved AVOID leg, §2). CAPITAL waits on it; parallel build toward another edge does not (§4 governor).

**FALSIFIED — Edge 3 / graph-as-mechanical-signal.** Dead, three independent reasons (§3). Kept in
the inventory only so "the graph" is never reread as a live tradeable signal. Its research-input
remnant + untested live core follow.

**RESEARCH-INPUT (built, gates nothing) + its untested live core:**
- **graph-exposure lookup** — built (§2); validated **operationally**, never statistically (so it
  can't be data-mined); feeds the human, decides nothing.
- **Non-consensus on AGGREGATION (the LIVE core of the graph thesis — NOT the dead mechanical
  signal).** Second-order / cross-sectional consequences of CONFIRMED PUBLIC events are mispriced
  because no one ASSEMBLES the affected cross-section (a regulatory change, a cost-input shift, a key
  customer's collapse hitting a diffuse long-tail no analyst covers as a group). It is a RESEARCH
  INPUT handing the human an exposed cross-section to research — it does NOT predict a tradeable price
  lag (that is the dead mechanical form, §3). **Face-valid proof-of-concept it is real — VRRM:** the
  Avis-termination 8-K's decision-relevant consequence was the *cascading RAC-channel-exit* across
  VRRM's customer cross-section — exactly the second-order assembly a human reasons about from
  source-bound facts (the dossier surfaced the Avis customer-concentration question, §2), not a
  price-lag prediction. **TRIGGER: build the active cross-section assembler per §4's GOVERNOR
  (validation-design-first — the baseline-beat test below), not single-threaded behind the spread** —
  it is a funnel WIDENER (second-wave, §4), sibling to the active event-detection layer. **KILL
  CRITERION when tested:** it must beat a hand-built baseline
  (the names a human assembles unaided on the same event) — surfaces nothing new → adds nothing →
  dropped. It must NEVER drift into "the graph predicts a move you trade."
- **Event-assembly (USTR / regulatory / major-news feed) — the aggregation edge's concrete form.**
  Edge = assembling the complete N-hop exposed cross-section from a **CONFIRMED public event**
  faster/wider than any human desk; the human judges mispricing. Serves the aggregation edge, **NOT**
  the overshoot screen (overshoot's catalyst is already EDGAR-bound post-hoc). Must FEED the human's
  assembly, never become a machine catalyst-SIGNAL (the dead-signal failure, §3). **VALIDATION:** tag
  each event-driven verdict "direct/obvious" vs "assembled/non-obvious"; proven ONLY if the spread is
  positive on the **NON-OBVIOUS** leg — positive only on obvious targets = no edge, just trading news.
  Gated; the **validation design is the deliverable NOW**, built when the §4 GOVERNOR greenlights.

**UNTESTED CANDIDATE EDGES (each gated; build the next per §4's GOVERNOR — validation-design-first, not single-threaded behind the spread):**
- **Edge 1 (orphaned quality) — the most DURABLE non-consensus** (also §4 first-/second-wave).
  Mispricing = neglect (no one's looking), not overreaction. No value-trap SYMMETRY problem
  (quietly-good-and-under-covered is more verifiable than overshoot-vs-terminal); persistence is
  structural (too small/boring for big capital; labor-intensive to underwrite). Deferred for
  measurability, not weakness.
- **Non-consensus on CLASSIFICATION.** The market prices a name by the wrong reference class (a
  changed business read as its old declining industry; a sound name lumped with real value-traps).
  AI-native fit: read the ACTUAL business from filings at breadth. Overlaps Edge 1/2 but the
  mispricing is taxonomic. KILL CRITERION: mis-classified names must re-rate when re-classified,
  **forward, not in hindsight.** Untested.

**THE THEME / TREND FAMILY** — AI-assembled reasoning about themes / trends / rotations. All three
share ONE failure mode and ONE discipline: they are **MOMENTUM-ADJACENT** — simpler replicable
strategies (momentum, trend-following) capture much of any theme move — so EACH is this fund's edge
**ONLY IF AI-assembly (selection / timing / exit discipline) beats a NAIVE MOMENTUM BASELINE**; the
momentum itself is replicable and is NOT the edge (§3 retired graph-momentum for exactly this —
arbitraged, fails the first-principle filter). All are **FREQUENT** (themes always running) → all
**PAPER-VALIDATABLE IN PARALLEL** against the baseline (per the §4 GOVERNOR — never capital, never
single-threaded ahead of the lead loop).
- **Theme-anticipation via AI-native assembly — LEGITIMATE; differentiated ONLY IF AI-assembly beats
  the naive baseline (corrects a prior over-dismissal AND a prior over-claim).** Get in EARLY: if
  AI-assembly anticipates themes better-calibrated than macro-fund intuition, that is a real moat over
  macro funds (the Vinci thesis) — **NOT** auto-rejected. But differentiation is **CONDITIONAL on
  clearing the momentum baseline, NOT inherent** — theme edges are momentum-flavored and momentum is the
  least-differentiated strategy. The distinction that matters is NOT "anticipate vs confirmed-catalyst"
  but "does the assembly beat a naive baseline," measured. Bets are **FREQUENT** (rotations resolve in
  MONTHS-TO-QUARTERS and are PLURAL — not few/slow), so it is **PAPER-VALIDATABLE NOW** in parallel; the
  gate is **ATTRIBUTION AGAINST MOMENTUM** (proving the assembly beats the baseline), NOT frequency —
  hard-to-validate, not long-gated-for-slowness. KILL CRITERION: benchmark AI-anticipated theme bets vs
  a naive momentum/macro baseline; real ONLY if it beats the baseline on a sample large enough to
  exclude luck.
- **Theme-participation via AI-native assembly — ride a CONFIRMED winning trend with disciplined
  rotation (get in LATE; the sibling to anticipation's get-in-early).** Examples: AI / semis /
  hyperscalers (2–3yr), gold / silver '23–'25, the SaaS / crypto / dot-com / housing cycles. **THE
  COLLISION:** this IS momentum in its purest form, so per the family frame it counts **ONLY IF
  AI-assembled SELECTION (which confirmed theme / which names) + human EXIT DISCIPLINE beat a naive
  trailing-stop momentum baseline.** **HIGHER BAR THAN ANTICIPATION:** for a *confirmed* trend the naive
  baseline is STRONG — a trailing stop captures most of a multi-year theme AND the late-retail
  self-reinforcing wave (the very dynamic cited as the opportunity) — so it must clear a high baseline,
  hardest exactly where momentum is strongest. **TEAM FIT is real** (the AI dev assembles theme / name
  breadth; the analyst judges real-and-durable vs late-and-exhausted; rotation discipline is human
  temperament) **but fit ≠ edge.** TRACTABILITY: frequent signals → a strong PARALLEL PAPER-VALIDATION
  candidate now; if AI-selection + exit-discipline beats the baseline over a few quarters → edge,
  graduate to capital; if it merely matches → it was momentum, learned cheaply, zero LP capital risked.
- **Causal-chain / second-order real-economy reasoning (e.g. an El Niño → input-cost → margin
  chain).** Reason forward from a confirmed physical/macro cause to the specific names it mechanically
  hits — the same family species (confirmed-cause → names, momentum/coincidence-confounded), the same
  baseline discipline. KEPT as a hypothesis, but the **LEAST validatable** of the set — the chain is the
  longest and most attribution-confounded, the hardest to separate from coincidence — so it has the
  **hardest validation design**, the last the §4 GOVERNOR greenlights (on attribution difficulty, NOT on
  being infrequent). Its limit is **attribution, not timing** — strong on *why/whether* a driver is
  intact, weak on *when* it tops (timing would be the dead signal, §3). Record-only.
- **Large-cap forced-de-rating — recorded at LOW credibility; a SEPARATE edge, NOT a ceiling
  change.** Forced/mechanical selling (index reconstitution, forced deleveraging, a flow-driven exit)
  temporarily de-rates even a large-cap below fair value. Logged so it is not re-discovered as novel,
  but credibility is **LOW** (large-cap mispricings are the most-arbitraged), and it is **explicitly
  NOT a reason to lift the $10B ceiling** (§6, RESOLVED-KEEP). If ever pursued it is its own edge with
  its own benchmark/calibration — not a widening of the overshoot universe.
- **Different-archetype mispricings — two sub-cases, opposite rulings.** (a) **Forced-flow /
  mechanical-structure plays** (SPAC/SPCX-style structural mechanics) are **NOT on the roadmap** —
  mechanical and replicable, not human-judgment edges; they fail the edge filter. (b) **Cross-filing
  contradiction** (the same fact stated inconsistently across a name's filings / exhibits /
  transcript) IS a genuine signal-edge — but **only as a DOSSIER INPUT** that flags the contradiction
  for the human, never a standalone screen or auto-verdict. (a) closed; (b) folded into the dossier's
  assemble-and-flag role if ever built.

**DELIBERATELY NOT RECORDED — the graveyard (considered and rejected; listed so they are not
re-proposed as fresh ideas):** sentiment / social signals, generic alt-data, patent-flow,
management-turnover screens. Rejected as replicable/arbitraged (sentiment, alt-data), weak/noisy at
this fund's scale, or simply not feeding the human-judgment edge (the edge filter). These are **out
of scope on purpose** — not "untested-but-promising."

**SCOPING QUESTIONS (where the edge LIVES — not new edges; full text in §6).** (1) **Cap-band
ceiling — RESOLVED 2026-06-22: KEEP $10B**, a deliberate proxy for where the overshoot edge lives,
coupled to the IWM benchmark + G2/G3 calibration. (2) **Sector-expertise — OPEN, data-gated** on the
now-built per-sector BUY−AVOID spread (§2): keep a sector where discrimination proves real,
learn-or-filter where it doesn't — the discriminator decides from the resolved spread, never a
pre-imposed filter.

Honest status of the graph thesis (corrects any flat "Edge 3 is dead" reading): the MECHANICAL graph
SIGNAL is dead (§3); the graph-exposure LOOKUP is built (§2); the AGGREGATION form (above) is
genuinely untested as a research input, with VRRM as a face-valid proof-of-concept. "Dead" applies
to the mechanical signal, not the whole idea.

**WORKED-EXAMPLE VALIDATION (2026-06-24, record-only — evidence the inventory is sound).** An external
two-name analysis (mid/small-caps, opposite directions) mapped against this inventory:
- **Already covered:** "cost-plus pass-through misread" (margin-% optical, EBITDA/unit intact) = the
  dossier's existing GAAP-vs-economic-reality reconciliation (VRRM-class); "pre-sales/P&L divergence"
  (bookings up, recognized revenue down on percentage-of-completion timing) = a textbook **OVERSHOOT**
  finalist (the market misreads a recognition trough as deterioration and sells). Both confirm the
  dossier's core competency **generalizes to unseen names — not new edges.**
- **Recorded-but-unbuilt, value confirmed:** sector-cycle positioning (separating sector de-rating from
  company signal) = the deferred SIC-cohort / §6 read; commodity-driver overlay (price → realization →
  margin beta) = an instance of the §4 causal-chain edge — the analysis confirms it is real AND confirms
  its recorded limit (*why/whether* the driver is intact, not *when* it tops; attribution feeds
  judgment, timing would be the dead signal, §3).
- **Framing refinement (kept):** the overshoot-vs-terminal job is precisely **classify the DURABILITY
  of the current driver, in either direction** — a name UP on a transient tailwind (priced for
  permanence) mirrors a name DOWN on transient weakness (priced for terminal); the fund (long-biased)
  targets the latter, and the dossier must flag whether the current driver is **durable or fading**.

## 5. Next steps (ordered, current)

The **dossier-assembler is built and verified (§2)** — the queue-top now flows ranker → `dossier`.
Remaining:

1. **Run real finalist cycles by hand** — top of the ranked queue → `dossier` → the human reads the
   source-bound bull/bear framing → logs a BUY/AVOID verdict via the ledger CLI with a frozen entry
   price. **First verdict DONE (2026-06-21): VRRM AVOID_TERMINAL, frozen $4.71 @ 2026-06-17, 180d** —
   the spread has its first (unresolved) leg (§2). Remaining: accumulate more verdicts — **especially
   BUY legs** (the spread is BUY−AVOID; one AVOID alone can't show separation) — and let them resolve
   over their horizons. (VRRM was logged with its CIQ dossier sections MISSING — pull the CIQ export
   per `dossier requirements` to populate the dossier for subsequent names.)
2. **Lightweight local frontend — DONE (2026-06-22, §2).** The read-only ops dashboard is built and
   **merged to main code-only** (PR #3); it runs locally against local data (renders committed
   snapshots; never trades or logs via UI). **Remaining is a SEPARATE later-stage step (not done): the
   Cloudflare deploy + committing the DERIVED licensed-adjacent artifacts** (`dossier.json`,
   `graph_coverage.json`) to the private repo — **gated** on verifying the deploy is genuinely
   private+authed (an unauthenticated request to the URL is rejected) and that `graph_coverage.json` is
   CIQ-free (§4 CONDITIONAL). Until then those artifacts stay git-ignored / local-only and nothing is
   deployed.

The ranker + dossier-assembler are built/verified (§2); the ranker's coverage-gap wire-ups
(EV/EBITDA-pctile + 8-K/guidance text, which also re-splits drawdown-character and turns on the live
Tier-3 LLM pass) are parked in §4 — **monitored in use, not chased**.

Then: operate the weekly loop and accumulate resolved verdicts.

In PARALLEL (per §4's GOVERNOR, not instead): a validation design may be drafted for the next edge —
event-assembly's obvious/non-obvious verdict tagging, theme-anticipation's naive-baseline benchmark —
so long as it never diverts verdict throughput from the lead loop. Design first; build on greenlight.

## 6. Open items carried from the fossils (live, not being worked now)

- **Regulatory/counsel** — HK SFC Type 9 (**blocks running real LP money**; longest calendar lead),
  POEM, FEMA/LRS on the own ~$200K, India-sourced management activity. Structure decided (HK co, USD);
  these are residual. Blocks real money, not code.
- **CIQ data-license scope** — blocks *automated* storage of CIQ-derived data (a go-live gate before LP
  money). CIQ stays manual-pull / git-ignored.
- **Return target** — under the objective (§1), NOT a fixed "beat index ≥2×" multiple but **returns
  sufficient to build LP confidence and grow AUM**, re-set quantitatively once the spread exists. (The
  old "beat index ≥2×" stretch conflicts with the ~15% floor by regime.)
- **Sector-expertise scoping — OPEN DESIGN QUESTION (operator-raised; do NOT act yet — the
  discriminator decides; sibling to the cap-band scoping below).** Small-cap drawdowns carry high
  value-trap / low-survival / terminal risk — that is CORRECT and is the premium the discriminator
  exists to underwrite, NOT a reason to flee to large-caps (where the overshoot edge is arbitraged away
  and human judgment has nothing to bite on). The tension: small-cap discrimination (overshoot vs
  terminal) often needs DEEP SECTOR EXPERTISE — biotech trial readouts, mining geology, niche-tech
  roadmaps — which sits against the fund's breadth/generalist assembly model. The dossier **assembles**
  sector facts; it cannot supply the **domain judgment** to weigh whether a specific drawdown is
  recoverable — and that is exactly where small-cap value traps hide from generalists. **The question:**
  across the sectors the overshoot screen surfaces, where does the human genuinely have the expertise to
  tell overshoot from terminal, and where not? If discrimination is high in some sectors and low in
  others, the honest instrument is **NOT** large-caps and **NOT** pretending breadth substitutes for
  depth — it is a **SECTOR FILTER** scoping the universe to where the discriminator's judgment is expert
  (gating for "can we tell trap from overshoot *here*?", the same way the cap band gates for *where the
  edge lives*). VRRM was judge-able from assembled facts (tolling/mobility, not deep-domain); a small-cap
  biotech at the same drawdown may be un-judge-able for a generalist regardless of dossier quality.
  **Resolution path — DATA-DRIVEN, not pre-imposed:** as verdicts resolve, track whether the BUY−AVOID
  spread is positive in some sectors and negative/noisy in others — a good per-sector spread means the
  expertise is real (keep); a poor one means learn it or filter it out. The scoping decision therefore
  waits on the resolved spread, but is **flagged now so the enabler lands early: verdicts must be tagged
  by sector from the first one**, or the per-sector read is impossible later. *Enabler BUILT 2026-06-22
  (§2): verdicts are sector-tagged at log time and the harness reads a per-sector BUY−AVOID spread,
  honestly "insufficient data" until each sector has both legs. VRRM stays the one untagged (pre-feature)
  leg — NOT backfilled, NOT rewritten; it buckets under "Unknown". The SCOPING DECISION itself remains
  OPEN and data-gated — it waits on the resolved per-sector spread; do NOT pre-impose a sector filter,
  the discriminator decides where the expertise is real.*
- **Fundamental vs quant — the decision is FUNDAMENTAL, the funnel is QUANT (operator-raised).** The
  fund is fundamental-for-the-VERDICT (overshoot vs terminal) and quant-for-the-FUNNEL (the screen's
  drawdown / idiosyncrasy / multiple filters) + risk-sizing. Do **NOT** add technical / price-pattern
  signals as DECISION inputs — replicable (fails the edge filter) and they don't solve the real problem
  (the generalist depth-gap). The depth-gap is bridged by the **dossier** supplying specialist-grade
  sector facts (FCF runway, covenants, segment economics, customer concentration) the generalist lacks;
  the per-sector spread (§2) measures whether it bridges — positive in a generalist-blind sector =
  dossier worked, poor = filter or learn it. **AI-disruption regime (relates to the small-cap terminal
  risk above):** AI re-rates software P/Es across all caps, but small-caps carry higher TERMINAL risk —
  survival needs the FCF / capital access mega-caps have and they don't. So AI-disrupted sectors
  (software esp.) are high-terminal-risk regimes where the overshoot-vs-terminal call is HARDEST; the
  dossier must surface FCF + liquidity runway prominently for these names (already extracted, §2), and
  the per-sector spread reveals whether discrimination there is real. **NOT a cap-ceiling change.**
- **Cap-band ceiling scoping — RESOLVED 2026-06-22: KEEP the $10B ceiling.** The universe is
  $300M–$10B; the upper $10B ceiling excludes **900 mega-caps** (CRM ~$143B, NOW ~$98B exit at
  `out_of_band`, before the screen — *traced this session, read-only*). **Decision: KEEP $10B.** The
  ceiling is a deliberate **PROXY for where the overshoot edge lives** — small/mid-cap de-rating human
  judgment can underwrite and big capital can't arbitrage; the excluded mega-caps are where the edge is
  largely gone, not overshoots worth hunting. It is **coupled to the IWM benchmark + G2/G3 calibration**
  (G2 measures idiosyncrasy *vs IWM*/Russell 2000; G3 uses own-history), so it is **not a free dial** —
  moving it would mean moving the band **and** the benchmark **and** G3 together, not a one-number
  change; not revisited until that whole small-cap calibration is deliberately reconsidered. **Distinct
  from the large-cap forced-de-rating hypothesis** (§4 edge-hypothesis ledger, item recorded LOW
  credibility) — that is a SEPARATE edge with its own benchmark, NOT a reason to lift this ceiling.
  **Re-derived under the objective (§1, returns→AUM→moat) — 2026-06-24.** The $10B ceiling carries a
  SECOND meaning the non-replicability-first framing hid: it is also a **CAPACITY CONSTRAINT** — a
  sub-$10B / $3M-ADV universe can absorb only so much AUM before own-buying slippage erodes the very
  returns the edge produces. **Edge 2 (overshoot):** ceiling KEPT now — **not binding at current AUM
  (~$1.2M)**; it correctly scopes where the edge lives, coupled to IWM + G2/G3 (above). **TRIGGER to
  revisit:** AUM grows to where the small-cap universe can't absorb capital without slippage — the
  strategy can outgrow its pond; record as a future re-examination, not a change now. **Edge 1
  (orphaned quality, §4 ledger) — NOT the same ceiling/floor decision.** Ceiling inherited ($10B;
  neglect above it is rare / arbitraged); the **FLOOR is the open parameter** — deepest neglect =
  thinnest names = worst capacity (a direct depth-vs-capacity conflict). **Do NOT hardcode a floor
  number** (an unvalidated guess; violates the face-validity / data-gated discipline). Decide it in two
  steps: (1) **CAPACITY MATH** sets the initial floor — current AUM × concentration → position size →
  required ADV at a safe participation rate → implied min market cap (arithmetic from known inputs,
  re-derived as AUM grows); (2) **SIZE-BANDED SPREAD** refines it — tag Edge-1 verdicts by size band,
  raise the floor toward "orphaned mid-cap" if deployable-neglect proves to live in larger names, keep
  it low if smaller names show a deployable positive spread. **Floor = function of AUM (capacity) +
  resolved spread, never a fixed number.** **PRINCIPLE:** parameters justified under
  non-replicability-first must be re-checked against returns→AUM→moat — under the old objective smaller
  was monotonically better; under the new one CAPACITY is a countervailing force, so past some point
  smaller = un-investable, which fights AUM growth.

## 7. The standing discipline

The edge is the discriminator's **hit-rate**, measured by the **BUY−AVOID spread**, which needs
calendar time. Validate **forward, never backtest**. Pre-register kill criteria; tune by
**face-validity, never by forward returns**. **The control says no** — trust the
de-confounded/control number over the persuasive story. **Manual** = the CIQ export + the verdict;
**automated** = everything mechanical between.

**Disciplined on CAPITAL, flexible on BUILD (§4 GATE).** Real capital waits on an edge's validated
spread — hard, unchanged. The BUILD does **not** single-thread: build toward + forward-validate edges
in parallel under the §4 GOVERNOR (validation-design-first, never starving the lead loop's verdicts).
Single-threading wastes validation's weeks-to-quarters latency; the 2-person failure mode is spreading
thin and validating nothing — so every parallel edge carries its own validation design before any
build, and capital still deploys only on whichever spread validates first.
