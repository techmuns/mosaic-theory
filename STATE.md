## 1. What this is

An AI-native, long-biased, US-first concentrated equity fund. The edge is **deep human judgment on
finalists**, applied at scale because an AI-native funnel feeds it. It is currently in **forward
paper-validation**: the only thing that gates going live with real money is the **BUY−AVOID forward-
return spread** on the manual discriminator's verdicts — which needs calendar time to accumulate.
**The fund is unproven: zero resolved verdicts so far, no spread yet.**

## 2. Built and verified (checked against the repo, not memory)

Each line: *what it does* — *verified how*.

- **Entity resolver** (`mosaic/resolver`) — US SEC CIK↔ticker↔name, fail-loud on unknown/ambiguous —
  *ran `resolve AAPL GOOGL GOOG BRK.B ZZZZZ`: GOOGL/GOOG→one CIK, BRK.B→BRK-B, ZZZZZ fails loud.*
- **Polygon EOD** (`mosaic/eod`) — whole-market grouped-daily, 5y history (Starter) — *universe/screen ran on 5y bars.*
- **EDGAR** (`mosaic/edgar`) — XBRL `companyfacts`/`frames` + 8-K full-text + submissions — *feeds G3; module + tests.*
- **Universe builder** (`mosaic/universe`) — market cap = close × XBRL shares, cap-band + $3M ADV +
  an **operating-cos-only gate on TWO fail-closed axes** — *`build-universe` ran → 1,727 names (drifts
  a few as SEC data updates).*
  - **Two independent operating-co axes, each fail-CLOSED on a missing value (exclude what we cannot
    confirm; never silently admit) — built + verified 2026-06-19 by a full rebuild:**
    - **Axis 1 — issuer BUSINESS type (EDGAR SIC).** Denylist `excluded_sic_codes =
      6189/6221/6722/6726/6770` (`non_operating=38`) PLUS a **blank/unknown SIC is now excluded**
      (`unknown_sic=29`) — closing the hole where a BDC with no EDGAR SIC slipped the denylist (`None`
      is never `in` the set). *The 29 are 28 BDCs (CION, OTF, Prospect, Main Street, FS KKR, Sixth
      Street, …) + 1 foreign miner; the BDC candidates CION/OTF/GLAD/MSIF/PFLT left the queue.*
    - **Axis 2 — security INSTRUMENT type (Polygon reference; `PolygonEodClient.security_types()`,
      one cached bulk pull).** An **ALLOWLIST** `allowed_security_types = CS/ADRC/OS/GDR` (domestic
      common / ADR common / foreign ordinary / GDR); everything else excluded, split for honesty into
      `non_common_equity=7` (a confirmed basket/derivative — SHNY=ETS, DHC/ILPT=FUND, MNR/NOVTU/VSECU=
      UNIT, CORZW=WARRANT) and `unknown_type=4` (absent from Polygon's reference = recently delisted,
      stale bars — MASI/KW/KALV/SCVL, last trade before the 06-17 ref). *SHNY left both the universe
      AND the queue; the 14 ADRC candidates (ABVX, ATHM, CHA, DQ, …) survive — ADRC is admitted, so
      operating-co ADRs are not dropped.*
  - **SHNY was NOT a resolver collision.** Its ticker→CIK (→ cik 927971, Bank of Montreal) is
    **correct** — BMO *issues* the SHNY ETN (one of 27 BMO tickers). It was an **untyped-instrument
    leak**: a leveraged ETN (Polygon type ETS) whose bank fundamentals describe none of it, now caught
    by Axis 2 — not by any ticker-validation (a collision guard was built, then reverted as the wrong
    diagnosis). Axis 2's fail-closed-on-missing also sweeps recently-delisted names the 90-day price
    gate still admitted (an as-of-now vs as-of-date asymmetry, acceptable for a forward-tradeable
    universe).
- **Screen 2 + gates** (`mosaic/screens`) — G1 drawdown ≤−30% (capped at −85% terminal floor) / G2
  idiosyncratic **vs the IWM market index** (NOT a sector cohort — see caveat) / G3 multiple vs ~5y
  floor (`_PE_WINDOW_DAYS=1825`); PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN, recall-favoring — *`screen` ran → 301 candidates
  (308 before the universe-axis fixes), A/B/C bands.* G1 drawdown = `last close / max(intraday HIGH
  over trailing 365d) − 1` (`eod/features.compute_price_features`, ≥330d history else UNKNOWN).
  - **G2 "idiosyncratic" is name-vs-IWM, NOT name-vs-SIC-sector (verified 2026-06-19; the field was
    then renamed `rel_ret_vs_sector` → `rel_ret_vs_market`, the old name being a lie — it compares to
    IWM, not a sector).** `assemble.build_price_record` sets it to
    `relative_return(name_bars, benchmark_bars, lookback_days=180)` = **name 180d trailing return − IWM
    180d trailing return** (`eod/features.relative_return`; `run.py` passes `benchmark="IWM"`). It is a
    *trailing return*, not peak-to-current drawdown. The SIC peer-cohort was **deferred and never built**
    (`features.py:135` leaves the field UNKNOWN, note "needs SIC peers (step 5)"; **no SIC-cohort /
    peer-aggregation code exists anywhere in `mosaic/`** — so the Part-1 sub-questions on SIC
    source/granularity/aggregate/thin-cohort are all moot). So G2 removes **market** beta only — a name
    that fell *with its sector* (sector-wide derate) still PASSES G2 if it merely lagged IWM. *Re-derived
    FUBO from raw bars: depth −84.3% (=snapshot, close 8.90 / 52w high-of-highs 56.64); idio −88.2%
    (=snapshot) = FUBO −72.6% − IWM **+15.6%** over 180d — the "−88% vs market" is FUBO's fall minus the
    small-cap market's RISE, no sector comparison at all.*
- **Ranker / triage layer** (`mosaic/rank`, `rank` CLI) — **orders** the ~307 candidates into a
  priority queue so a 2-person team deep-pulls the most structurally-promising overshoots first.
  A *transparent* weighted composite of the Tier-1 axes (idiosyncrasy .30 / drawdown-depth .25 /
  **drawdown-character .25** / multiple-vs-own-5y .20 — **face-validity weights, never
  return-tuned**), + a minor Tier-2 volume overlay (±0.05, panic-exhausted vs still-distributing),
  coloured by a Tier-3 LLM cause-annotation that only **demotes/colours** (structural-break vs
  mean-revert, `UNCLASSIFIED` by default — never fabricated). *drawdown-character folds shape (sharp
  vs grind) and cause (discrete event vs bleed) into ONE axis today — both rest on the same EOD
  gap-down detector, so two axes would be false precision; splits back out when 8-K/guidance TEXT
  events land (§4).* Tradeability is an **ADV gate** (not a quality signal; default floor = universe
  floor, a no-op re-check — adds no filtering). **Orders, never decides; a lagging/coincident
  description of the existing setup, not a return prediction.** **Replaces the bare A/B/C band with a
  legible per-name structural profile** (score *and* profile are the same artifact — priority score +
  per-axis breakdown that sums back to it; A/B/C kept only as a quick depth tag). Fail-loud: an
  UNKNOWN axis earns 0 credit and is flagged for depth, never imputed — *ran `rank` on the committed
  308 snapshot → top-15 legible profiles, every position reconstructs from weight·sub-score + overlay
  (ICCM's 61.7× active-distribution overlay sinks it from a top-2 quality to #6); 156 UNKNOWN-multiple
  names flagged; ADV floor $10M gates 75 thin names to the queue bottom; a structural-break flag
  demotes FUBO #1→#12 while mean-revert lifts PAR #3→#1. 20 tests incl. an AST guard that
  `mosaic.rank` imports no scoring/ledger/store (no forward-return path). Emits
  `ranked_queue.{jsonl,md}` snapshots.*
  - **Coverage caveat (an upstream data gap, NOT a ranker defect):** the ranking is **most reliable
    for names with a *confirmed* at-floor multiple, weaker for the ~51% without one** —
    multiple-percentile is present for only ~49% (P/E only; **EV/EBITDA pctile never populated** →
    that axis is UNKNOWN/0-credit, flagged, for the rest); **market_cap is 100% UNKNOWN** so
    tradeability rests on ADV alone; **events are 100% EOD `earnings_gap_down`** (no 8-K/guidance
    text — so drawdown-character is one axis, and Tier-2 reads *current* volume, not volume-at-the-
    gap). All handled fail-loud (UNKNOWN → 0-credit + flagged, never imputed) — correct behaviour; the
    fix is upstream coverage (§4), recorded not chased.
- **Dossier-assembler** (`mosaic/dossier`, `dossier` CLI) — per-finalist; **assembles and cites, NEVER
  concludes.** A deterministic source-bound MECHANICAL layer (every fact a `{value, source_ref}`: P/E +
  percentile / FCF-sign / net-leverage from the screen's EDGAR data-record; the gap-down **8-Ks** fetched
  + bound as the de-rating cause; **idiosyncratic-vs-shared** = name vs IWM 180d return + the graph-exposed
  cohort's same-window returns (the G2-vs-market compensation; graph is INPUT, never a predictor);
  share-count/dilution from EDGAR XBRL; CIQ multiples/quality/segments/customers/consensus from a
  **manual** export) + a *fenced* LLM SYNTHESIS whose ONLY input is those facts: bull/bear cases, 3–6
  **named** twin analogues, the decisive question, key unknowns. **The synthesis schema has NO field for a
  verdict / recommendation / direction / score / probability — concluding is structurally impossible**,
  locked by a test that walks the schema (mirrors the ranker's no-forward-returns guard); a second AST
  guard proves the package imports no `ledger`/`scoring` (logging the BUY/AVOID stays the human's act).
  Post-LLM guardrails flag for human review: uncited points (each must cite a source_ref in the input),
  untraceable figures (scale-aware: every number must trace to a mechanical value), numeric/unsourced
  twins, directional language. CIQ via a swappable **ManualDataStore** — `LocalFolderStore` live
  (`data/manual/ciq/<ticker>/`, git-ignored); `DriveStore` an unimplemented interface (CIQ is
  manual-export-only by licence). Missing CIQ → sections MISSING + a "pull CIQ" flag, batch continues;
  parallel across the cohort. *Verified: `dossier --ticker FUBO` end-to-end → mechanical facts
  source-bound (P/E 12.0 at the 0.16%ile of its 5y range, FCF-sign −1, −88.2% vs IWM, 2 gap-down 8-Ks
  bound with accessions, shares 29.6M→342.4M +1055%; CIQ MISSING + flagged; graph cohort UNKNOWN — FUBO
  not in the graph) + a live verdict-free synthesis (claude-sonnet-4-6), every figure tracing to the
  mechanical layer; 11 dossier tests incl. the no-conclusion-field schema guard + the no-ledger import
  guard. Writes `data/dossiers/<ticker>/{dossier.json,dossier.md,llm_call.log}` (git-ignored — may carry
  licensed CIQ).*
  - **Cause-parsing + integrity hardening (VRRM run, 2026-06-19) — the dossier must see catalysts that
    live in 8-K TEXT and never mislabel cause.** (1) Each gap-down is labelled by its **8-K item codes**
    (2.02 earnings / 5.02 management change / 8.01 other / 1.02 agreement-termination / 4.02 restatement
    / 3.01 delisting) — never blanket "earnings". (2) The 8-K body is parsed for the **source-bound
    catalyst** (the customer/contract/executive action, bound to the accession), fail-loud
    "UNKNOWN — read filing by hand" when unparseable; free EDGAR only. (3) Share-count trend uses a
    **trailing ~2y** window (a 7y endpoint delta hid the current posture). (4) A **P/E-basis flag** fires
    when trailing EPS is far out of line with the name's recent EPS history (a multiple at its 5y floor
    can be an EPS-numerator artifact — verify vs normalized/forward CIQ). (5) Cite-check **tightened**:
    a "field X is missing" point that cites an unrelated PRESENT field is flagged + un-cited (it belongs
    in key_unknowns). *Verified: VRRM's three drops now read earnings (2.02) / other-event-Avis-
    termination (8.01) / management-change (5.02) — NOT three earnings misses; the 8-K text surfaced
    "termination notice from Avis Budget" + the executive change, source-bound to accessions; the P/E
    1%-ile flagged as an EPS artifact (latest 0.85 vs median 0.28); the synthesis decisive question is
    now the Avis customer-concentration question, not a false repeated-earnings-miss premise.*
  - **CIQ loader → workbook-aware addressing model (VRRM, 2026-06-19) — the prior loader couldn't
    reach the subsheets, so every CIQ section read MISSING.** CIQ Financials is ONE ~13-subsheet
    workbook (Income Statement / Cash Flow / Multiples / Segments / Capital Structure Details / …);
    Estimates is its own; **Multiples lives in BOTH** (historical in Financials, forward in Estimates).
    The old filename-keyword `module→file` match never opened a subsheet. New model: each module
    resolves to an explicit **(workbook-kind, sheet-name) ADDRESS** via one accessor
    (`bundle.sheet(kind, name, freq)` → rows or fail-loud `CiqUnavailableError`); adding a consumer =
    register an address + write its extractor, no loader re-architecture. **`xlrd` added** so legacy
    `.xls` (BIFF) parses. Per-sheet reading rules bound to the sheet: partial-period **last column
    excluded** from the Multiples history but used as "current"; **Reclassified boundary** never
    YoY'd across; frequency read **verbatim** from Income Statement "Period Type", never shape-
    inferred; empty / `-` / `Entitlement Needed` all → UNAVAILABLE; per-sheet date formats (string /
    Excel-serial / datetime). The four formerly hard-MISSING fields now extract: **free_cash_flow,
    ev_ebitda_percentile_5y, interest_coverage, liquidity_covenant_flags**. **Transcripts** module
    added: earnings-call files are Word-disguised-as-`.rtf` (OLE) → routed through LibreOffice/Word,
    NOT striprtf; fed as a **qualitative** input only (no numbers derived). *Verified: VRRM re-run —
    segments PRESENT (Commercial Services 436/45%, Parking 83/8%, Government 461/47% of 979),
    EV/EBITDA (TEV/LTM) 8.5x at the 0%ile of 19 closes, FCF 53.9, EBITDA-margin 37%, interest-cov
    5.6x, term-loan/notes liquidity table, EPS rev 1↑/5↓ & revenue 0↑/8↓, customers — all PRESENT and
    source-bound; geographic UNKNOWN (section present, extractor not wired) and transcript UNKNOWN
    (LibreOffice not installed) — honest fail-loud, not fabricated. 6 new workbook tests (subsheet
    routing finds Multiples+Segments inside Financials; partial-col exclusion; Reclassified guard;
    blank/`-`/Entitlement→UNAVAILABLE; missing-workbook MISSING vs absent-sheet UNKNOWN).*
  - **Silent-misread reconciliation (VRRM, 2026-06-19) — extraction can be wrong without failing
    loud; checked extracted-vs-known-correct, fixed 3, flagged 1.** The fail-loud path can't catch a
    value that parses but means the wrong thing. (1) **Segment EBITDA now surfaced** — the Segments
    sheet's EBITDA section parses to exact figures but only Revenues was read; the dossier showed
    Commercial Services at **45% of revenue** while hiding that it is **~68% of EBITDA** (Avis sits
    in the profit-concentrated segment). Added `segment_ebitda` (same `_segment_section`,
    `section="EBITDA"`); render BOTH revenue-share and EBITDA-share; it reaches the synthesis (the
    bear case now cites "68% of segment EBITDA vs 45% of revenue"). (2) **Margin YoY LTM-vs-FY guard**
    — the revenue YoY was dividing LTM-ending-Mar-2026 by FY-Dec-2025 and printing "+0%", a silent
    period mix (notes ~line 204); added an LTM/FY guard beside the Reclassified guard → now
    "UNAVAILABLE (LTM-vs-FY period mix)"; single-column margins (gross 57%, EBITDA 37%) unchanged.
    (3) **EV/EBITDA dollar-scalar fixed** — `valuation.ev_ebitda` rendered **352,494,000** because
    `screens/assemble.py:162` feeds it `snap.ebitda_annual` (EBITDA dollars) into a multiple-named
    field; the dossier now sources the **CIQ TEV/LTM multiple (8.5x)** via `ev_ebitda_current`, never
    the EDGAR scalar. **Root cause also fixed at the producer** (separate commit): `assemble.py:162`
    no longer writes EBITDA dollars into `ev_ebitda` — the field was always meant to hold the
    (deferred, never-built) **EV/EBITDA multiple**, so it now defers to UNKNOWN ("needs net-debt/EV"),
    matching its percentile sibling. **No rename / no snapshot migration / no alias** — a bare rename
    would have broken the 301 committed `candidate_records.jsonl` (required key, strict-parsed by the
    dossier/ranker/CLI loaders); verified both legacy-float and new-UNKNOWN parse under the unchanged
    `DataField[float]` schema, +2 regression tests (producer defers; committed snapshot still loads).
    (4) **Adjusted-EPS — FLAGGED, not built** (LibreOffice still absent): two flags
    now fire — the surfaced EPS is GAAP-based and the company-adjusted (~1.35) figure lives in the
    transcript/earnings-release reconciliation (UNAVAILABLE); and the EDGAR P/E (5.5x) **conflicts
    ~3× with the CIQ P/LTM EPS (16.8x)** because the EDGAR trailing EPS is one-time-inflated — the
    synthesis must not anchor on 5.5x as "cheap" (it still cites it; the flag is the human's guard).
    (4b) **Leverage-basis — FLAGGED** (same GAAP-vs-adjusted theme): net debt/EBITDA reads **2.9x on
    consolidated GAAP EBITDA**, but management/credit-covenants define leverage on **adjusted EBITDA**
    (larger denominator → ~2.5x); the adjusted-EBITDA reconciliation is in the release/transcript
    (UNAVAILABLE), so the covenant-basis ratio isn't surfaced — flag only, not re-sourced (the
    adjusted measure is not the CIQ segment-sum and isn't in the Financials workbook). *Verified on
    VRRM (4 flags fire) + 3 new regression tests (segment-EBITDA share, LTM/FY YoY guard, ev_ebitda is
    a multiple).*
  - **⚠ LANDMINE (unbuilt — insider/Form-4):** when insider data is wired, the CIQ **Transaction-Type
    direction-flip** (`ciq_extraction_notes` ~line 80) MUST be handled — the Type column signs the
    trade, so a naive `net_shares_sold` summed off raw quantities is **sign-flip wrong** (buys and
    sells counted with one sign). High-severity: it would invert the insider-flow read. No insider
    extractor exists yet — this is a warning for whoever builds it.
  - **Graph-cohort coverage caveat (report-only):** only **~4% (11/301)** of the ranked candidates are
    in `graph_coverage.json` (built on a narrow slice, not the candidate universe) — so the
    idiosyncratic-vs-shared **graph-cohort read is effectively dormant at the dossier stage**; 96%
    (incl. FUBO, VRRM) fall back to the name-vs-IWM read with cohort UNKNOWN. Activating it needs the
    graph built across the candidate universe — deferred, not rebuilt.
- **Decision ledger** (`mosaic/ledger` + `store`) — append-only: `append_ledger` is INSERT-only and
  **no `clear_ledger`/ledger-DELETE exists anywhere** — *2 verdicts across 2 processes both persist;
  survives `clear_candidates`+`clear_universe`+`export_snapshots`; re-log → `sqlite3.IntegrityError`.*
- **Scoring harness** (`mosaic/scoring`) — BUY−AVOID spread = `buy_mean_return − avoid_mean_return`
  (benchmark-free), over **resolved** verdicts only — *synthetic +20% BUY / −20% AVOID → spread +40%.*
- **Entry-price freeze** (`store.close_as_of`) — clamps to `bar_date ≤ reference_date`, fail-loud if
  none, staleness kept on top — *Phase-0 lookahead fix; 3 shown cases + regression test; commit
  `a3b63bb` on `main` (orig `b9d438d`, rebased).*
- **graph-exposure** (`mosaic/graph/exposure`, `graph-exposure` CLI) — given an entity, returns N-hop
  exposed names with 10-K provenance — *`--entity TSM` → 32 names within 2 hops (incl. Apple via
  Cirrus); unit test. This is research-input only — see §3.*
- **GitHub Actions cron** (`.github/workflows/weekly-screen.yml`, `monthly-score.yml`) — present.
  *Manual trigger preferred for now.*
- _Whole suite green (ruff + mypy --strict clean; `pytest -m "not network"` passes)._

## 3. FALSIFIED — tested and retired (NOT deferred)

**The fossils call the graph "the differentiator." That is wrong, and recorded honestly here:**

- **Edge 3 / graph-as-mechanical-signal (shock-propagation): FALSIFIED.** Test 1 (`mosaic/graph/test1`,
  `scripts/run_test1*.py`) returned **two clean nulls on the sector-deconfounded column**: same-sector
  semis (signal vanished after SOXX-adjustment); cross-sector (live pooled −1.0% vs own-sector, while
  the control AMZN posted +1.0% — *that was the n≈8–16 noise floor*; the apparent vs-IWM signal was
  beta). Retired for **three independent reasons**: (1) null on the data, twice; (2) supply-chain
  momentum is a ~17-yr-old published, arbitraged anomaly → **replicable**, fails the
  hard-to-replicate first principle; (3) the only direction it hinted at was a **short on illiquid
  small-caps** — untradeable for a long-biased mandate.
- **What survives:** the graph as a **research-input lookup** (`graph-exposure`) for the human
  discriminator. It gates nothing and makes no trade decision. Validated **operationally** (vs a
  hand-built baseline on a live event), never statistically — so it can't be data-mined.

## 4. Deferred — built only after the gate clears

**GATE:** nothing here is built until the **BUY−AVOID spread shows the discriminator adds value** —
≥2 quarters of *resolved* verdicts, positive and large enough to be real, not noise. Building any of
it first is the premature-investment trap. *Verified absent from the repo today* (no
execution/sizing/portfolio/monitoring modules; only `SourceTier.IBKR` labels in schemas).

**FIRST WAVE — unlocked directly by a positive spread** (turns the *proven* Edge-2 loop into real money):
1. **Position sizing / risk / portfolio construction** — trigger: spread positive. First, because you
   can't size until you know the edge is real, and sizing precedes execution.
2. **Execution (IBKR)** — trigger: sizing built **+** spread positive **+** the regulatory gate (§6,
   SFC Type 9) clear for real money. Hard-deferred; paper until all three.
3. **Monitoring / thesis-break / decay** — trigger: live positions exist (i.e. after execution).

**SECOND WAVE — widen the proven funnel** (only after the Edge-2 loop is real and running):
4. **Edge 1 (orphaned quality) screen** — trigger: Edge-2 loop validated **and** running smoothly.
   Reuses the same ranker + dossier-assembler on a different (neglect-based, not drawdown-based)
   screen — the strongest funnel expansion.
5. **Active event-detection feeding `graph-exposure`** — trigger: Edge-2 loop validated; bandwidth
   free. An alerting layer on the existing lookup (**not** the falsified mechanical screen) — surfaces
   exposed cross-sections to the human on a real event; decides nothing.

**CONDITIONAL — only if separately earned** (not gated on the spread):
- **Verification harness (LLM bull/bear/judge)** — trigger: only if running the manual discriminator
  reveals it needs a structured bull/bear step. May never be needed; do not build speculatively.
- **Drive adapter for the dossier-assembler** — trigger: the local-folder assembler is proven and the
  manual export→folder step is the real friction. A convenience, not a milestone.
- **Close the ranker's coverage gaps** — wire **EV/EBITDA-pctile history** + **8-K/guidance TEXT
  events** (the latter also splits drawdown-character back into shape + cause and feeds the Tier-3
  LLM cause-pass, which then reads filing text instead of `LLM: —`). Trigger: **only if the gap
  proves to bite during real finalist selection** — i.e. the ~51% UNKNOWN-multiple names or the
  un-split character axis visibly distort the queue-top in use. **Monitor in use; don't chase
  preemptively** (the ranker already handles the gaps fail-loud — §2 coverage caveat).

### Candidate edge-types — untested hypotheses (DO NOT build; record-only)

These are recorded so the reasoning survives; they are NOT next steps. The binding constraint is
proving Edge 2 (the empty spread), not expanding the edge inventory. Build toward none of these
until the spread validates the discriminator.

- **Edge 1 (orphaned quality) — already in §4 above; noted here as the most DURABLE non-consensus.**
  Mispricing = neglect (no one's looking), not overreaction. Unlike Edge 2 it has no value-trap
  SYMMETRY problem (was-it-an-overshoot-or-terminal is the hard call; is-it-quietly-good-and-
  under-covered is more verifiable), and its persistence reason is structural (too small/boring for
  big capital; labor-intensive to underwrite). Deferred for measurability, not weakness.

- **Non-consensus on AGGREGATION (the LIVE core of the graph thesis — NOT the dead mechanical signal).**
  Hypothesis: second-order / cross-sectional consequences of CONFIRMED PUBLIC events are mispriced
  because no one assembles the affected cross-section (e.g. a regulatory change or cost-input shift
  hitting a diffuse long-tail no analyst covers as a group). DISTINCT from the falsified Edge-3
  mechanical signal: this is a RESEARCH INPUT that assembles a cross-section of exposed names FOR THE
  HUMAN to research — it does NOT predict a tradeable price lag. The mechanical-lag form is dead
  (§3, three reasons); THIS aggregation form was never tested. KILL CRITERION if ever tested: it must
  beat a hand-built baseline (names the human would assemble unaided on the same event) — if it
  surfaces nothing the human wouldn't already find, it adds no value and is dropped. It must NEVER
  become "the graph predicts a move you trade" — that is the dead mechanical signal returning.

- **Non-consensus on CLASSIFICATION.** Hypothesis: the market mis-categorizes a name into the wrong
  reference class (treats a changed business as its old declining industry; lumps a sound name with
  real value-traps), so it's priced by the wrong comp set. AI-native fit: reading the ACTUAL business
  from filings across many names at breadth. Overlaps Edge 1/2 but the mispricing is taxonomic.
  KILL CRITERION if tested: must show mis-classified names re-rate when re-classified, forward, not
  in hindsight. Untested.

Note the honest status of the graph thesis (corrects any flat "Edge 3 is dead" reading): the
MECHANICAL graph SIGNAL is dead (§3). The graph-exposure LOOKUP is built (§2). The broad
thesis — cross-sectional/second-order consequences are mispriced — was tested ONLY in its
narrowest, most-arbitraged, least-tradeable form (1-hop propagation lag), and its AGGREGATION
form (above) remains genuinely untested as a research input. "Dead" applies to the mechanical
signal, not the whole idea.

## 5. Next steps (ordered, current)

The **dossier-assembler is built and verified (§2)** — the queue-top now flows ranker → `dossier`.
Remaining:

1. **Run one real finalist cycle by hand** — top of the ranked queue → `dossier` → the human reads the
   source-bound bull/bear framing → logs a BUY/AVOID verdict via the ledger CLI with a frozen entry
   price. Produces the first genuine verdict, **starts the spread**. (Pull the finalist's CIQ export
   first, so the dossier's CIQ sections populate instead of flagging MISSING.)
2. **Lightweight local frontend** — read-and-trigger ops dashboard (ingestion health; the **ranked
   queue with per-name structural profiles** (§2); `graph-exposure` labeled research-input; ledger;
   spread showing 0 verdicts honestly). Read-only, renders committed snapshots, never trades or logs
   via UI. Cloudflare Pages auto-deploy applies **here** (static frontend on committed snapshots),
   not before.

The ranker + dossier-assembler are built/verified (§2); the ranker's coverage-gap wire-ups
(EV/EBITDA-pctile + 8-K/guidance text, which also re-splits drawdown-character and turns on the live
Tier-3 LLM pass) are parked in §4 — **monitored in use, not chased**.

Then: operate the weekly loop and accumulate resolved verdicts.

## 6. Open items carried from the fossils (live, not being worked now)

- **Regulatory/counsel** — HK SFC Type 9 (**blocks running real LP money**; longest calendar lead),
  POEM, FEMA/LRS on the own ~$200K, India-sourced management activity. Structure decided (HK co, USD);
  these are residual. Blocks real money, not code.
- **CIQ data-license scope** — blocks *automated* storage of CIQ-derived data (a go-live gate before LP
  money). CIQ stays manual-pull / git-ignored.
- **Return target** — the "beat index ≥2×" stretch is provisional and conflicts with the ~15% floor by
  regime; re-set once the spread exists.

## 7. The standing discipline

The edge is the discriminator's **hit-rate**, measured by the **BUY−AVOID spread**, which needs
calendar time. Validate **forward, never backtest**. Pre-register kill criteria; tune by
**face-validity, never by forward returns**. **The control says no** — trust the
de-confounded/control number over the persuasive story. **Manual** = the CIQ export + the verdict;
**automated** = everything mechanical between.
