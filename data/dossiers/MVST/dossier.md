# Dossier — Microvast Holdings, Inc. (MVST)

## ⚠ Analyst caveats — verify before the verdict

- Net debt/EBITDA (3.9x) is on REPORTED EBITDA (CIQ / consolidated GAAP), not the covenant basis; management and credit covenants typically define leverage on adjusted EBITDA (a larger denominator → a lower ratio), reconciled in the earnings release/transcript (currently UNAVAILABLE) — do not read 3.9x as the covenant-basis leverage.
- Catalyst-path as-of UNVERIFIABLE — the CIQ Estimates export carries no as-of stamp; its data is on/after 2026-05-15 (the latest embedded revision event), but the true export date is unknown, so freshness vs the 2026-06-22 reference cannot be confirmed. Re-pull, or corroborate against a dated sibling CIQ export.

## Synthesis (LLM — framing for the human, every point source-bound)

**Evidence balance:** mixed — a real FCF-positive margin turnaround collides with a sharp Q1 revenue/operating-EBITDA collapse against 5.8x leverage and a 2026 maturity wall.

### Bull case (overshoot / mean-revert)
- The name is FCF-positive and self-funding, with LTM levered free cash flow of $39.6M, which materially reduces the terminal/dilution-spiral risk that sinks pre-profit battery names.
  - ↳ `CIQ Financials→Cash Flow 'Levered Free Cash Flow' [LTM 12 months Mar-31-2026]`
- Interest coverage of 10.6x indicates the debt load is currently serviceable out of operating earnings despite the leverage optics.
  - ↳ `CIQ Financials→Income Statement EBITDA ÷ Interest Expense [LTM 12 months Mar-31-2026]`
- On fundamentals the name screens BETTER than the peer median on several axes — EBITDA margin 14% vs 6%, EBITDA growth 21% vs 1% — posing whether the EV/EBITDA discount (11.1x vs peer median 14.5x) is a RESIDUAL overshoot rather than fully EARNED; but the peer set is flagged heterogeneous, so this is a confidence-gated input, not a clean benchmark.
  - ↳ `CIQ Comparable Analysis→Operating Statistics (name vs peer median: growth/margin/leverage/beta)`
- Consensus forward path shows a recovery ramp — FY27E revenue $592M and FY27E EBITDA $148M vs LTM $372M/$52M — consistent with management's Phase 3.2 capacity narrative and a temporary-dip reading of Q1.
  - ↳ `CIQ Financials→Income Statement + Cash Flow (annual) + Estimates→Trends (FY E)`
- The multi-year margin turnaround is real and load-bearing: EBITDA margin swung from -118% (2021) to 17% (2025) with absolute EBITDA moving -180 to +74 over the same span, so this is a genuine profitability inflection, not an optical artifact.
  - ↳ `CIQ Financials→Income Statement (margin % + absolute EBITDA reconciler)`
- Both covering brokers rate the name Buy with a $5.50 mean target, and recent GAAP net-income/EBT revisions were UPWARD (H.C. Wainwright FY26 EBT prior 59.42 → current 75.69), a genuine counter to the derating.
  - ↳ `CIQ Estimates→Consensus`

### Bear case (terminal / value-trap)
- Leverage is well above peers on the comps basis — total-debt/EBITDA 5.8x vs peer median 2.0x — and against a shrinking LTM EBITDA base this is a load-bearing EARNED component of the discount, not merely optical.
  - ↳ `CIQ Comparable Analysis→Operating Statistics (LTM Total Debt/EBITDA) · as-of 2026-06-24`
- There is a near-term maturity wall in 2026, including two shareholder convertible term loans (SOFR+9.750%) due 2026-05-28 and a China bank facility due 2026-12-10, concentrating refinancing/rollover risk against only $126M cash.
  - ↳ `CIQ Financials→Capital Structure Details (A 2025 filed Mar-16-2026)`
- The Q1-26 GAAP net profit of $48.2M was driven by a $63.8M non-cash fair-value swing on warrant/convertible liabilities; management's own reconciliation shows an adjusted net LOSS of $14.6M and YTD adjusted EBITDA of NEGATIVE $5.5M vs +$28.5M prior year — headline profit masks operating deterioration.
  - ↳ `CIQ transcript(s): Microvast Holdings, Inc., Q1 2026 Earnings Call, May 11, 2026.rtf; Microvast Holdings, Inc., Q4 2025 Earnings Call, Mar 16, 2026.rtf`
- Revenue is contracting sharply, not just dipping: Q1-26 revenue fell to $61M with -37% QoQ and -25.5% YoY (Q1-26 vs Q1-24), and LTM revenue $372M is BELOW FY25 $428M — the top line is going backwards, the REAL signal, not an optical timing effect.
  - ↳ `CIQ Financials→Income Statement + Segments + Ratios (multi-year columns)`
- The Q1-26 EBITDA margin collapsed to 0% (absolute EBITDA ~$0 on $61M revenue) from 19% a year earlier — reading the % alongside the absolute confirms this is a genuine deterioration in the most recent quarter, not a margin-mix illusion.
  - ↳ `CIQ Financials→Income Statement (margin % + absolute EBITDA reconciler)`
- Consensus estimates have been cut hard through the derating — FY26 revenue -27% and FY26 EBITDA -52% (12m→latest) — and the stock fell -82% relative to the small-cap benchmark over 180d, so this is an idiosyncratic, estimate-driven collapse.
  - ↳ `CIQ Estimates→Trends (current-FY consensus path; ragged, absent lookbacks n/a)`
- Revenue is 100% concentrated in a single Battery Systems segment with heavy geographic exposure to China (33%) plus regulatory disruption in Korea and EMEA platform ramp delays cited by management, so there is no diversification cushion against the current demand shortfall.
  - ↳ `CIQ Financials→Segments (Revenues, latest annual column)`
- Short interest rose +22.9% to 26.3M shares (DTC 5.7d) and the share count is diluting (+2.9% trailing ~1.7y), signals of ongoing bearish positioning and equity issuance overhang.
  - ↳ `FINRA consolidated short interest (settle 2026-06-15); DTC = 26,323,600 short ÷ 4,607,454 screen 90d ADV`

### Decisive question
**Is the Q1-26 revenue and operating-EBITDA collapse a temporary trough tied to Phase 3.2 ramp timing and Korea/EMEA program delays (mean-revert to the FY27E ramp), or the start of a structural demand/scale erosion that keeps the shrinking-EBITDA base pinned under a 5.8x-leverage, 2026-maturity-wall balance sheet (value trap)?**

### …evidence for
- Management frames the YoY dip as temporary and tied to Phase 3.2 capacity coming online through 2026, with a new 290Ah LFP/KAF school-bus powertrain as a growth vector.
  - ↳ `CIQ transcript(s): Microvast Holdings, Inc., Q1 2026 Earnings Call, May 11, 2026.rtf; Microvast Holdings, Inc., Q4 2025 Earnings Call, Mar 16, 2026.rtf`
- Consensus forward path embeds a sharp recovery — FY27E revenue $592M and EBITDA $148M vs LTM $372M/$52M — consistent with a trough-then-ramp reading.
  - ↳ `CIQ Financials→Income Statement + Cash Flow (annual) + Estimates→Trends (FY E)`
- The name is FCF-positive ($39.6M LTM) with 10.6x interest coverage, buying time to reach the ramp.
  - ↳ `CIQ Financials→Cash Flow 'Levered Free Cash Flow' [LTM 12 months Mar-31-2026]`

### …evidence against
- Q1-26 revenue fell -37% QoQ to $61M with operating EBITDA at ~0%, and LTM revenue $372M is already below FY25 $428M — the erosion is in the actuals, not just guidance.
  - ↳ `CIQ Financials→Income Statement (margin % + absolute EBITDA reconciler)`
- FY26 consensus EBITDA was cut -52% (12m→latest) and revenue -27%, so the near-term estimate base is moving down, not up.
  - ↳ `CIQ Estimates→Trends (current-FY consensus path; ragged, absent lookbacks n/a)`
- Total-debt/EBITDA of 5.8x (vs peer median 2.0x) against a 2026 maturity wall means a prolonged trough directly threatens refinancing capacity.
  - ↳ `CIQ Comparable Analysis→Operating Statistics (LTM Total Debt/EBITDA) · as-of 2026-06-24`

### Key unknowns
- No forward-basis EV/EBITDA or adjusted figures were in the revised guidance, and the trailing multiple is flagged trailing-only over just 4 closes (<8q), so the floor read is low-confidence and cannot distinguish cheap-overshoot from cheap-terminal — this is an unresolved neutral fact, not directional.
- Resolution of the 2026 maturity wall is unknown: an 8-K dated 2026-05-28 (the shareholder convertible term-loan maturity) is flagged 'read for resolution' but the outcome is not in the facts — a MISSING expected disclosure that is a bearish refinancing risk until confirmed.
- No revised-outlook 99.1 exhibit was parsed for either earnings 8-K, so management's explicit FY26 guidance revision is not captured — an opacity gap on the forward guide.
- Named covenant terms for the debt instruments are UNKNOWN (extract pending) — covenant headroom against declining EBITDA cannot be assessed, a bearish opacity risk.
- Segment-level EBITDA is not disclosed (Segments sheet has no EBITDA section), so profitability of the single Battery Systems line cannot be decomposed — an opacity gap.
- The peer set is flagged HETEROGENEOUS (market caps span $34M–$275.0B, 8063x); every peer-median multiple and fundamental delta must be treated as confidence-gated, not a clean benchmark, before reading any discount as residual overshoot.
- Whether the EV/EBITDA discount to peers is EARNED (worse leverage/shrinking scale) or RESIDUAL (unexplained by fundamentals) is for the human to judge — not computed here — and is confounded by the heterogeneous roster.
- Only 2 brokers cover the name (both Buy, N=2), so consensus target and ratings breadth are thin and low-confidence.

### Twin reference cases
- **Amprius Technologies** — recovered
  - distinguished by: Fellow small-cap US-listed battery maker in the same peer roster; a high-growth, still-negative-margin story trading well above the name — the analogue for a battery name the market prices on future ramp rather than trailing profit.
  - source: CIQ Comparable Analysis→Financial Data + Business Description (roster + caps + business)
- **Forsee Power S.A.** — went terminal
  - distinguished by: Micro-cap peer battery-systems maker with negative EBITDA margin and declining revenue — the analogue for a sub-scale battery supplier whose demand shortfall compounds against a small revenue base.
  - source: CIQ Comparable Analysis→Financial Data + Business Description (roster + caps + business)
- **Leclanché SA** — went terminal
  - distinguished by: Small-cap peer battery maker with deeply negative EBITDA margin and net debt — the analogue for a levered sub-scale energy-storage name where the balance sheet, not the technology, becomes the binding constraint.
